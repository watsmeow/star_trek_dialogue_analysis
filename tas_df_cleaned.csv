Mister Sulu? Stand by to reverse course. Reverse course. Why aren't our sensors picking it up? Forward scanners, Mister Sulu. Full reverse thrust. How much time do we have? Sulu, flank speed ahead. Our only chance is to try to get into orbit around that thing. Steady as she goes, Mister Sulu. Maintain orbit. Slingshot effect, Mister Spock? Do we have enough power? Put us alongside, Mister Sulu. It's been damaged. I'll bet she was pulled in like we were. You're sure, Mister Spock? Can you identify that metal, or the design of the ship? A civilisation that advanced three hundred million years ago before life even emerged on Earth. Mister Spock, any indication of that ship's power source? We'll board her, Mister Spock. Scotty, Bones, you'll come with us. We'll need life-support belts. Mister Sulu, have the Transporter room stand by. Activate life-support belts. Energise. Like a spider spins his web. Look, every pod, they've all been burst open. Kirk to Enterprise. Lieutenant, are you still getting that radio signal from this ship? All right. Lock on us with the transporter and be ready to transport. We're going inside. What do you make of it, Spock? You mean it's functioning after all the milleniums this ship has been here? Compared to the beings that built this ship, we are primitive people, even you, Mister Spock. All right, let's keep going. Tricorder analysis, Mister Spock. Enterprise, do you read me? Sulu? No energy registering. Something's drained them. For the moment. This is, was, the control centre of the starship. These must be control and navigational instruments. Will it hold? I'm not sure, but I think It could be a ship's log or a warning. It seems to keep repeating. Anything? Get out of here! Hurry! Transport it back out. Status? So, we're all just fine, but whatever was on that ship used our transporter beam to come aboard with us, and now it's here. Until we learn more about it, Scotty, perhaps we should be ready to do the same. Take two of your men and arm the self-destruct device in the Engineering core. Mister Spock, any change in ship's readings? Like the beating of a heart. Bridge to Sickbay. Bones, get down to the Engineering core on the double. Get on those life-support systems now. Override systems, Mister Spock. Open the core hatch. All right, get the cutter beams on that hatch. Move. And mutual override did not work? The cutter beams. Spock, can you rig a low-frequency shield like the one on the alien ship, on our navigation console? Do it. Do you get a magnetic flux reading there now? No. It must be held by the magnetic force of the dead star, and it needs a starship to break free and a crew to man it. You have shut down life-support systems and endangered members of my crew. Restore those systems first. And if I refuse? Stop! You'll hurt him. I'll obey. Let him go. Mister Scott, start repairs. Install the auxiliary controls. What are we dealing with, Spock? A slingshot effect to yank us out of orbit. Can you compute it in your mind? If we try to use ship's computers The engineer will need aid from my first officer to complete repairs. Is that permitted? I guess it is. Plot the course, Mister Sulu. I'm aware of that, Mister Spock. The auxiliary warp drive controls can only be operated manually. Controls activated. Standby to activate warp drive unit.

The twentieth day of Tasmeen. That was the day my cousin saved my life in the desert when I was attacked by a wild animal. I do not recall clearly. I was very young. He called himself Selek. He was visiting us, but I never saw him after that. I believe so, Captain. And I know what you're thinking. It was I who saved myself that other time. I do not remember everything. There is a vague memory from a child's point of view, but the details are not clear. Yes. I will need a Vulcan desert soft suit and boots, and a small selection of streetwear circa 8877 Vulcan years. The carry bag should be of the same period. Andorians are not known for their charity. And you in yours, Commander Thelin. I wish to visit the planet Vulcan, thirty years past, the month of Tasmeen. Location, near the city of ShirKahr. In the family, all is silence. No more will be said of it. Live long and prosper, Sarek of Vulcan. My name is Selek, an humble cousin descended of T'Pel and Sasak. I am journeying to the family shrine to honour our gods. I am honoured. Is something wrong, Cousin? A family resemblance to our forefathers, no doubt. No, my lady Amanda. Any child has much to learn. My young cousin has a more difficult road to travel than others. It is difficult for a father to bear less than perfection in his son. Spock will find his way. The boy goes through the kahs-wan ordeal soon, does he not? But tomorrow is the twentieth day of Tasmeen. I seem to have lost track of time. Personal log, stardate 5373.9, subjective time. The timeline seems to have changed again. Yet I do not believe I have done anything to disrupt it. My memory is quite clear regarding the date my cousin saved my life, and it is tomorrow. The kahs-wan ordeal is an ancient rite of warrior days. When Vulcans turned to logic, they reasoned they must maintain the tests of courage and strength to keep pure logic from making them weak and helpless. Of course. I should have remembered. It wasn't the actual kahs-wan ordeal. I suggest we move away from this area before the le-matya regains consciousness. It was my duty, Spock. The lady Amanda is known for her graciousness. I dare say you will. Come now. I suspected you would go. You are worried about the kahs-wan ordeal. That is your father's wish? She is a human woman, with strong emotion and sensitivities. She embarrasses you with those traits, and you are afraid when you see them in yourself. There is some human blood in my family line. It is not fatal. What you do not yet understand, Spock, is that Vulcans do not lack emotion. It is only that ours is controlled. Logic offers a serenity humans seldom experience in full. We have emotions but we deal with them and do not let them control us. The le-matya struck him with its poison claws in the fight. Yes. We cannot get him back to the city to a healer. He is too large to move. You are a Vulcan. What is the logical thing to do? It is a long journey across the desert. There are many dangers. I will go. This did not happen before. My life decision was made without the sacrifice of yours, old friend. I know there is pain. I can help a little. Sleep now. It will not be long now, old friend. You made the desert crossing most efficiently. You will not disappoint Sarek in your kahs-wan. A Vulcan would face such a loss without tears. By understanding every life comes to an end when time demands it. Loss of life is to be mourned but only if the life was wasted. I-Chaya's was not. I too must make my farewells. Your hospitality has been most kind, but I must journey on. Try to understand your son, Sarek of Vulcan. It will be repayment enough for me. I think I shall not. Peace and long life. One small thing was changed this time. A pet died. It might, to some. Doctor McCoy, you do not know your good fortune. IF the times were different, you would have to recalibrate for an Andorian. Times change, Doctor. Times change.",52

The signal is coming from a star system twenty light years away. It is the Taurean system. A small star at the extreme edge of this sector. It does resemble a summons. Fascinating. Like a Vulcan marriage drum. I am experiencing audio-visual suggestion, Captain. Logically, we must assume they are created by the probe. Readings are still inconclusive. It is odd that only the men are affected, Captain. I suggest Captain, the urgency of our feeling suggests visual compulsion. I advise remaining at a distance until I can determine the extent of its influence. The life forms are indicated in its centre. The form is humanoid, but there are many internal differences. Their bodies appear to function on an unusual psychokinesis level. Tonal control. Fascinating. We must return to our duties aboard ship. Yes. Your medikit, Doctor. It may contain something which will help us. Perhaps they saw no practical use in it. If the lock is magnetised, this may disrupt its field. I have noticed that their glow diminishes when the women are not present. They could be polarised conductors which transfer our vital energy to the bodies of the women. That would account for our rapid aging, Captain. And our weakness. If you recall, the women seemed listless at first. But as our strength has failed, they have become more energetic and vital. We seem to be aging ten years per day, Captain. I have retained more strength than any of you. My internal structure is different, Captain, my life span longer. It is wiser if I go to the temple to try and find the communicators and contact the ship. The equipment belonging to the men of the Enterprise, where is it? Spock to Enterprise. Request rescue party. All-female. Repeat. All-female. All Miss Chapel. Miss Chapel. Christine. Instruct female engineer to divert ship's energy into deflector shields. Block probe. Use all ship's energy.

There's no place for cover if we meet any other creatures. The bearing on the signal we heard is that way. I've seen something very like it on Canopus Three, but that's light years from here. Still, this desert area is the same as on Canopus. I've seen stranger things, Mister Spock. Kirk to Enterprise. Any new information, Scotty? North east. That's where we got the signal from. All right, Scotty, keep scanning. Kirk out. I don't know. But at least they're alive. I choose to believe they are. In other words, it's too good to be true. Yes, but terraforming usually follows a pattern. This seems like random choice. Gentlemen, please. We have work to do. We're still alive, aren't we? Phasers on full stun. No. They're like the dragons on Maravel. The stun charge should get them. If that's true, Spock, then Towards the north-west, toward the city Scotty reported. That must be five square kilometres. Any ideas, Doctor? Which is? A more important question, gentlemen, is whether or not there's a way out of here. A force field. It seems harmless enough. And we are definitely on the inside. You said you were picking up impressions. Are the aliens telepathic? Surely we can communicate with them some way. They took our phasers, communicators and other equipment so they must have some idea we're intelligent. We've got to communicate with them. Look ahead. Better do what they want for now, anyway. They activated another force field. On this planet, Bones, they seem to be the people and we are the animals. James Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise. First Officer Spock. Our physician, Doctor McCoy. You've what? There were six of you on the mission. What have you learned about the aliens? Have you tried an escape? We seem to have company. Spock, try and make contact. You seem to be getting a response. Let's find the others. I feel a need for human companionship. How is she? The Lactrans outside, what do they do? Do they feed us or do we shift for ourselves. Always to the same place? What display case? Maybe we can get them to give them back to us. They must have sensed a need and interpreted it as food. What's your evaluation of the situation, Markel? As long as we're alive, there's a chance. Tonight, I'll try and find a weak link in the force field. Gentlemen, since they are learning from us, why don't we learn something from them? They communicate telepathically. How much have you learned? My orders were not to attempt a rescue under any condition. Go ahead. Let's try it, and let's be close to the communicator when we do. I'll pretend I'm sick. All of you concentrate. Once I get my hands on a communicator, I can have Scotty beam us all aboard the Enterprise. Ready now. Enterprise, this is Captain Kirk. Beam us aboard. I'm worried about the Enterprise. The best thing we can do is Argh! They're in my head. What happened to the baby? What happened? Yes. I think so. I can't hold out against that many. No. No! Let me alone! Please! They're destroying me! Tearing my mind to, to I'm all right. Scotty, what are you doing here? What did you learn? Then how did you get here? What else do they know about us? Backward child, but growing. Do we get out of here? Everyone ready to transport? Kirk to Enterprise. Prepare to beam aboard two parties, all human. Offhand, I'd say we learned to keep our hands off. Which is? Our time, or theirs. Either way, Mister Spock, it will hardly be our problem.",98

Is this not the shape of your people's primitive temples? The Vedala were right. There are no living creatures here, only the mechanised sentinels. I too would prefer to press on, Captain. The mechanicals on guard may be what Sord saw tracking us earlier. Or there may be others. In either case, it would be more advantageous to avoid another encounter. The walls are not climbable. You suggest sabotage, Captain? Approximately eighty two point five percent in favour of the possibility. The planet is geologically unstable. This structure is inherently flexible, enabling it to withstand earthquakes. It is locked in a force field. Your rope would merely bounce off it. I cannot define the field's energy base, Captain, but Most of them will be killed. The warrior races of the Federation will rise up to battle the Skorr. Last week with you, Captain.

Mister Spock, keep watch. There's some kind of interference on all channels. We're going to have to get out of this village on our own. I concur, Mister Spock. Set phasers to stun, just in case. Fire. I'm paralysed. Who are you? I am Captain James Tiberius Kirk of the starship Enterprise. This is my first officer, Mister Spock and honorary Commander Ari bn Bem of the planet Pandro. It is our mission. We must classify this planet. We have to test it. There are times, Mister Spock, when I think I should have been a librarian. Commander Bem, Mister Spock and I are here because we thought that you were worth rescuing. It was more to preserve the diplomatic relations between the Federation and planet Pandro than from any great affection for yourself. Wait! Unlock us. Set us free! It's worth a try. Kirk to alien intelligence. This is Captain James Tiberius Kirk calling the ruling intelligence of this planet. Answer me, please. Mister Spock, whatever we're dealing with, I don't think we can bribe it. We must be honest. Kirk to alien intelligence. I don't think it's strong enough to be noticeable. Do it. This is Captain James Tiberius Kirk calling the ruling intelligence of this planet. Do you hear me? Kirk to entity. Kirk to entity. We apologise for intruding. We did not realise the situation. We will leave. We will tell others of our kind not to bother you here. Just one thing. There is a third member of our group. He has fled. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Stand by. We're not leaving without Bem. He is our responsibility. We can't leave him here. Beam down a security squad with heavy duty tricorders set for Pandronian scanning. Thanks, Scotty. Spread out. Find Commander Bem. He's split into three individual parts. He's some kind of colony creature. And take care not to injure any of the natives here. Phasers on lightest possible stun setting. And don't fire unless absolutely necessary. Let's get out of here before we make any more trouble. You have endangered all of us by your actions, and you have forced us to interfere with the natives of a planet that deserves prime directive protection. Not on my ship you don't. We could not leave one of our own behind. It is our responsibility to take care of our own, just as it is your responsibility to take care of yours. We could not leave him here where he might further interfere with your, your children. He is found, and we will leave. Disassemble? We will go now. Kirk to Enterprise. Beam us up. Stand by to break orbit. Mister Spock, classify this planet as being strictly quarantined. Under no circumstances may any Federation vessel approach. It is necessary. Not only for them, but for us as well. Mister Spock, the difference is meaningless. In comparison, we're all still children. Take us out of orbit, Mister Sulu. Let's go home.

None as yet, sir. But sensors now indicate it is twice our size. Vessel appears extremely unorthodox in design. And Starfleet lists no other authorised vessels in this quadrant. Approaching ship has an immense energy field surrounding it. Fascinating. Readings indicate the vessel is composed entirely of crystalline ceramic. I would almost say We have been encased in a globular force field, Captain. The source is the approaching vessel. It is a force globe, but one that is flexible enough to absorb any force. I cannot explain it. Clearly we cannot escape by simply fleeing. Sensors indicate we at now being probed. Evasive action will not be effective, Captain. The force globe limits our manoeuvreing. Still approaching, Captain. Going sublight. It continues to probe us. Its surrounding energy pattern is now shifting. Captain, library computer confirms that Ensign Walking Bear is correct. The Mayas had a legend of a winged serpent god who came from the skies, bringing knowledge. Such legends were not uncommon among Earth's peoples, Captain. Entirely possible. Captain. Lieutenant Uhura, you are supposed to be monitoring the alien vessel. Our first priority is to free the Enterprise and ourselves. Return to your duties. Of course. The elasticity of the force field can respond in only one direction at a time. All hands to battle stations. Full impulse power, helmsman. Tractor beam on, full power. Warp engines on standby. Mister Arex, prepare to compensate for warp catapult effect. When we break free, we will be thrown approximately five point six nine eight light years. The force globe is flexible in only one direction per unit of time. We shall both push and pull on it simultaneously. It should become rigid enough for a burst of warp power to shatter it. Full warp power on my order. Now. Reverse engines and come about. Lay in spiral evasive course for Kukulkan's ship. Interesting, Captain. The creature was the Mayan god from the ancient legends.
