It is the Borgia variety, Captain. Could not have caused Darnell's death. Spock here. Acknowledged. Something odd, Captain. You said two people. We get a reading on only one person, probably Crater. He's circling as if searching for something. Yes, sir. The simple fact is unless there's something seriously wrong with the ship's equipment, there's only one person within a one hundred mile circle. Spock cutting in, Captain. Something here, through the arches to your left. Green. Or something did. Crater knows the creature. If we could take him alive. Obviously, taking him alive is going to be difficult. Why risk your life for his? Acknowledged. Crater! The Earth buffalo. What about it? And now they're gone. Is that what you mean? Always in the past tense. Supplies of salt have been set out as bait at all decks and engineering levels, Captain. However, no one or nothing has approached them as yet. Your attitude is laudable, Doctor, but your reasoning is reckless. A very interesting hypothesis, Doctor. Briefing room. Recommend we use truth serum, Captain. I'll accompany you, Doctor. It wasn't McCoy. It was the creature. It hit me. Crater grabbed my phaser. I wondered about McCoy. Doubt had crossed my mind. Fortunately, my ancestors spawned in another ocean than yours did. My blood cells are quite different. It's killing the Captain. Shoot it, Doctor, quickly! It's killing the captain! Shoot, quick! This is not Nancy. If she were Nancy, could she take this? Is that Nancy, Doctor? Something wrong, Captain?",46

Lieutenant Uhura, take over this station. Report to Sickbay, Mister Riley. Security. Mister Riley is headed for Sickbay. See to it he arrives. Captain Kirk to the Bridge. Lieutenant Brent, relieve Miss Uhura. Nonviolent at this stage. Slightly disoriented. Riley seemed rather pleased with himself, as if he were Precisely. Fascinating. A pattern is developing. First, Tormolen. Hidden personality traits being forced to the surface. Then Riley, who fancies himself a descendant of Irish kings, and now Sulu, who is at heart a swashbuckler out of your 18th century. Gravity pull increasing. We've shifted to two percent and should stabilise our position. Engine room, we need power! Take D'Artagnon here to Sickbay. Captain. At our present rate of descent, we have less than twenty minutes before we enter planet atmosphere. Status reports, all sections. Go to Alert Baker two. Seal off main sections. We're going to seal off, Captain, if we can minimise the spread of whatever this is. No way, Captain. He controls the main power panels. He can override any channel from down there. Seventeen minutes left, sir. Sixteen minutes left, Captain. We've stabilised, but still spiraling down. Crewman, report to the lab! What's going on? Crewman, stand aside. Message from the captain. We have fourteen minutes left. At the rate you're proceeding, calculations show that you'll take a minute and a half more than we have left. You can't afford a safety factor. Nurse? Where is Doctor McCoy? Lab. Lab, respond please. Spock here. Lab! What is it, Nurse? Nurse, you should I'm in control of my emotions. I'm sorry. I am sorry. Christine. I'm in control of my emotions. Control of my emotions. I am an officer. An officer. My duty. My duty is, is. My duty is to, to. Too late. I'm sorry. To. Two, four, six. Six. Six times six. My mother. I could never tell her I loved her. An Earth woman, living on a planet where love, emotion, is bad taste. I respected my father, our customs. I was ashamed of my Earth blood. Jim, when I feel friendship for you, I'm ashamed. t's never been done! Understand, Jim. I've spent a whole lifetime learning to hide my feelings. It's never been done. Jim. Jim, there is an intermix formula. It's never been tested. It's a theoretical relationship between time and antimatter. Stand by to intermix. I'll call the formulae in from the Bridge. Fuel temperature. Raise antimatter eight and forty degrees. We haven't the time. We'll have to risk it. Bridge, we're ready. Are you all right, Jim? Obviously, we were successful. The engines imploded. Engine power went off the scale as well. We're now travelling faster than is possible for normal space. We're back to normal time, Captain. Yes, sir. We've regressed in time seventy one hours. It is now three days ago, Captain. We have three days to live over again. This does open some intriguing prospects, Captain. Since the formula worked, we can go back in time, to any planet, any era.",80

It was split into two halves and suddenly thrust back together again. Thus shock induced by blind terror. It couldn't understand. You can. You have your intelligence controlling your fear. Aren't you forgetting something, Captain? Your men on the planet surface. How much time do they have left? Being split in two halves is no theory with me, Doctor. I have a human half, you see, as well as an alien half, submerged, constantly at war with each other. Personal experience, Doctor. I survive it because my intelligence wins over both, makes them live together. Your intelligence would enable you to survive as well. Are you relinquishing your command, Captain? Captain, I thought the plan We'll let the captain handle this. You'll have to hold on to him, Captain. Captain? Understood, Captain. Ready. Right away, Captain. All sections report ready, sir.

Beam down two security men. Some delay in meeting us. Probably nothing at all. Kirk out. Corridors could be quite deep. Getting here may have taken more time than he estimated. Don't worry. Rayburn, maintain post here. Matthews, we'll look for Doctor Korby. Accompany us. Is that you, Doctor Korby? Is there a path down there? Any chance of a projection or a ledge? Not soon enough. You do know him well? An old friend? Captain Kirk to Rayburn. Report. We lost Matthews. Apparently an accident. Tell the Enterprise to have a full security party standing by. And we'll both report in at hourly intervals. If you and I lose contact, or if he fails to hear from either of us, he's to beam the security party down immediately. Kirk out. Where is Doctor Korby? There's no need to apologise, sir, and certainly no need to introduce yourself. It wasn't your fault. Kirk to Rayburn, report. I'm required to make a security confirmation. When I call my ship, if you list your personnel, cargo requirements, any special needs Rayburn, are you receiving? I've lost contact with my guard. I'm required to call my ship. Sir, one man is dead. I've lost contact with the other. What are you doing? Drop it! Enterprise from Captain Kirk. Come in. Do you read? Contact established with Doctor Korby. No problem, Mister Spock. Bear with me. Yes, I know your reputation. The whole galaxy knows who you are and what you stand for. That's why all this makes no sense. Or disobey an order from her. Doctor, do I need to be a prisoner to be convinced? A simple layman's question, Doctor. Where is my other crewman? Alive? Dead? Where is my other crewman? He's an android like Brown? You've convinced me, Doctor. You've convinced me that you're dangerous. If these mechanical things have no feelings and perform only as you programme them, then why did Brown try to shoot me? Why did he kill two of my men? There are many things I don't understand, Doctor. Mind your own business, Mister Spock. I'm sick of your half-breed interference, do you hear? Mind your own business, Mister Spock. I'm sick of your half-breed As far as I know. Well, there's one difference between us. I'm hungry. Eating is a pleasure, sir. Unfortunately, one you will never know. He's an exact duplicate? What about memory? Tell me about Sam. He saw me off on this mission. He said he was being transferred to Earth colony two research station. Obviously, I can't, but we do have some interesting differences. Programming. Different word, but the same old promises made by Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar, Hitler, Ferris, Maltuvis. It can also be improved by eliminating love, tenderness, sentiment. The other side of the coin, Doctor. All you wanted before was my understanding. Yes, yes. No one need know, only to frighten uninformed minds. You've created your own Kirk. Why do you need me? I'm impressed, Doctor, but not the way you think! Stand back, Ruk! I'll kill him! Stay back. Christine, is that you? Andrea, kiss me. What's the matter, Andrea? Confused? Emotion, Ruk? You disapprove of Miss Chapel's orders to save my life? Why? Can't your memory banks solve a simple equation like that? What happened to the old ones, Ruk? Is it possible they built their machines too well, gave them pride and a desire to survive? Machines that wanted logic and order and found that frustrated by the illogical emotional creatures that built them? And isn't it Korby who's creating the same danger to you all over again? Unlike you, we humans are full of unpredictable emotions that logic cannot solve. And Korby? The danger to you is Korby. The old ones programmed you, too, but it became possible to destroy them. That's it, Ruk! Logic! You can't protect someone who's trying to destroy you! You were a man with respect for all things alive. How can I explain the change in you? If I was to tell Earth I was in your hands, to tell them what has become Spock. He must've got my message. She killed the android, Korby, the same way you killed Ruk. Is this your perfect world, your flawless beings killing off one another? Aren't you doing exactly what you hate most in humans, killing with no more concern than when you turn off a light? Then prove it. Give me that phaser gun. If there's any human left in you, give it to me. Andrea, give me the weapon. In here, Spock. Doctor Korby was never here. She's staying with the ship. Something bothering you, Mister Spock? I'll remember that Mister Spock, the next time I find myself in a similar situation. Steady as we go, helm.",80

Acknowledged, Lieutenant. I have their calculations now. According to their life prolongation plan, what they thought they were accomplishing, a person would age only one month for every one hundred years of real time. Exactly, Yeoman. Evidently through some miscalculation, this virus annihilated the entire adult population in a very short period, leaving only the children. Could very well be immensely old. Difficult, if we can't even get a glimpse of them. Impossible. They know the area too well, like mice. Is at least three hundred years older than you are, Yeoman. Think about it. Acknowledged. This fellow made these notes in the last weeks after the disaster began. I disregard these last entries. He said himself he was too sick, too far gone to be sure he wasn't already mad, and I agree, but based on the entries he made before that, I know how much time we have. The ship's computers will verify my figures. Our guess was correct. They contract the disease as they enter puberty and their metabolism changes. The notes would indicate it doesn't become acute for a month or so. I estimate she has perhaps five or six weeks left. The older the victim, the more rapid the progress of the disease. I am a carrier. Whatever happens, I can't go back to the ship, and I do want to go back to the ship, Captain. I presume my calculations are correct. Spock here. Verified, Captain. We have seven days. Unfortunately, they weren't successful. We've seen the results. No, nothing. Communicators, Captain, they're gone. The nitrogen cycle, it has to be. That is a very good question. That's not all, Captain. We've got to find those communicators. We've got to have those communicators, Jim. Without them, it could be a beaker full of death. We must. The vaccine could be fatal. Bickering is pointless. I'll check on the Captain's progress. Not yet. He injected himself with the vaccine. He was unconscious when I found him. The blemishes are fading. They're fading. Who will understand the medical mind? Captain? Warp factor one, Captain.",51

I'd like another look at that area. This is turning out to be one very unusual shore leave. How? What's the matter, Bones, you getting a persecution complex? I know the feeling very well. I had it at the Academy. An upper classman there. One practical joke after another, and always on me. My own personal devil. A guy by the name of Finnegan. Serious? I'll make a confession, Bones. I was absolutely grim, which delighted Finnegan no end. He's the kind of guy to put a bowl of cold soup in your bed or a bucket of water propped on a half-open door.

Stand by, Mister Spock. No problem, Commissioner. And may I remind you that I have standing orders to investigate all quasars and quasar-like phenomena wherever they may be encountered. Besides, it's three days to Makus. And the rendezvous doesn't take place for five. No problem. Captain to Galileo. All systems cleared for take off. Launch shuttlecraft. Anything at all? Try and get me a fix on the Galileo. That thing out there has ionized this complete sector. None of our instruments work. At least four complete solar systems in the immediate vicinity. And out there somewhere, a twenty four foot shuttlecraft, off course, out of control. Finding a needle in a haystack would be child's play. I'm aware of that, Commissioner. At the same time I have certain scientific duties I must perform, and investigating the Murasaki effect is one. We have two days to find them. What would you have me do, turn around and leave them there? Thank you, Lieutenant. Mister Sulu. Set course for Taurus Two. If they're not there, Commissioner, then they're dead by now. Mister Sulu. Anything on your scanners? Have you tried tying in to the auxiliary power? Transport room, this is the captain speaking. Are the transporters beaming up yet? Thank you. This is the captain speaking. Flight deck, prepare Columbus for immediate exit, for a search of the planet surface. Correlate co-ordinates with Mister Sulu. Thank you. Anything, Uhura? We have until 2823.8 to continue the search, Commissioner. Look, these people are my friends and my shipmates. I intend to continue the ship's search for them until the last possible moment. I'm familiar with the regulations, Commissioner. I know all about your authority. Launch shuttlecraft Columbus. Have them proceed to the next quadrant. Any word from engineering on our sensors? What about the transporters? Thank you, Lieutenant. Yes, Commissioner? I haven't forgotten, Commissioner. I haven't forgotten that, Commissioner. This is the captain. Try using overload power on the transporters. We've got to get them working. Uhura, order the Columbus to open its course two degrees on every lap from now on. It also means we have a fighting chance to cover the majority of the planet's surface. Mind your helm, Mister Sulu. Good. This is the captain. Landing parties one, two, and three, report to transporter room for immediate beaming down to surface of the planet. Ordinance condition One A. I'm depending on luck, Lieutenant. It's almost the only tool we have that'll work. What word from the sensor section? I'm not interested in the last report. I want to know now. I'm perfectly aware of how much time I have left. You do that. What about radio communication? Do? I intend to continue the search. Foot by foot, inch by inch, by candlelight if necessary, until the last possible moment. And if you'd keep your nose off my bridge, I'd be thankful. I'm in command here, Mister Ferris. Put Lieutenant Kelowitz on visual. Report. There are casualties? Thank you, Lieutenant. You'd better report to Sickbay yourself. But they're still out there. The Columbus hasn't returned yet. I still have two search parties out. Lieutenant. Order the transporter room to immediately beam up the two search parties from the surface. Attempt to contact the Columbus. Then have them return immediately. Mister Sulu, prepare to abandon search. Set course for Makus Three. What about the other systems? Stand ready, Mister Sulu. How long before the Columbus comes on board? Twenty three minutes. Mister Sulu, proceed on course for Makus Three, at space normal speed. Those are my orders. Lieutenant Uhura, order all sensor sections to direct beams aft. Full function, continuous operation until further orders. Sensors, a meteorite? A hundred and eighty degrees about, Mister Sulu. Lieutenant Uhura, contact transporter room. All beams ready. Full normal speed. Activate beams. Mister Sulu, proceed on course to Makus Three. Ahead warp factor one. Mister Spock. There's really something I don't understand about all of this.

Then, breaking free will shoot us forward in time, and we'll transport you back before any of this happened. Since we've passed Mercury, the sun's pull on us has increased greatly. From here, we'll move even faster. And Captain, notice the chronometers. They've started backward. Minute by minute, the speed of time passage will now increase. Approaching breakaway point. On the countdown. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. We've broken free and heading back. Chronometers moving forward again, Captain. Computed. Twenty minutes, sir.

Nothing yet, Ambassador. We're awaiting a reply. Today's the first time we've had any evidence they've picked up our signal. Are you sure? Code seven-ten means under no circumstances are we to approach that planet. No circumstances what so ever. Mister Fox, it is their planet. By disregarding code seven-ten, you might well involve us in an interplanetary war. You are. I'm thinking about this ship, my crew. Yes, Mister Spock. This is the Captain. Condition Yellow Alert. Phaser crews stand by. Deflector shields up. We're going in. Peacefully, I hope. But peacefully or not, we're going in. Anything else? Not alone. I'm taking some security people with me. I can't risk beaming you down there until I know what kind of reception you're going to receive. Your safety is my responsibility. Those are my orders, sir. Mister Spock. What co-ordinates? Final sensor readings? Ship's defences? Good. Landing party will pick up phaser number one's from the arsenal. Keep them inconspicuous. Mister Scott. The ship is yours. Take care of her until I come back. We'll do our best. Let's go. I'm Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the United Federation of Planets. Yes? I had orders to come here. Why did your people tell us to stay away? I see no danger here. I'm Captain Kirk. This is my first officer, Mister Spock, Lieutenants Galloway, Osborne, Yeoman Tamula. My mission is to establish diplomatic relations between your people and mine. Would you mind telling me why? You're still at war? You conceal it very well. Mister Spock? To say the least. Don't you take shelter? What is it? Do you hear any explosions, Mister Spock? Mea, if this is an attack, may I ask what weapons the enemy is using? Kirk to Bridge. Scotty? Scanners operative on the planet's surface? Anything unusual? Thank you. Kirk out. Sir, I have been in contact with my ship, which has had this entire planet under surveillance. All during this so-called attack of yours, we have been monitoring you. There's been no attack, no explosions, no radiations, no disturbances whatsoever. If this is some sort of game you're playing Computer don't kill a half million people. To report? You mean to tell me your people just walk into a disintegration machine when they're told to? What has happened? We require a great deal. I wish to speak to Anan Seven. He'll have more casualty lists than he knows what to do with if he doesn't get in here and talk to me. Your duty doesn't include stepping into a disintegrator and disappearing. Is that all it means to you? To report and die? Then how can you stand No, I don't see that at all. Yes. Anan Seven. Good news, Mister Scott. The Eminians have agreed to the establishment of full normal diplomatic relations. They've also extended an invitation to all personnel to come ashore, for shore leave. They've assured me that our people will have a wonderful time. Are you sure you can do it, Mister Spock? Do your best. Thank you, Mister Spock. We get our communicators back and try and contact the ship. Mister Spock, we'll need more weapons. We'll try to take it easy, but if we're forced to kill A disintegration machine. Mea. What do you think you're doing? You're not going in there. No you're not. Mister Spock, that guard. I'll cover you. All right, you people, clear out of the way. Throwing a monkey wrench into the machinery. I've done it. Come on, let's get out of here. The last place they'll look for us is the place we escaped from. Cover the door. Are you that anxious to die? Mister Spock, how did that little raid work out? Will it reach the ship? Work on it. We've got to contact the ship. Mea, I want you to give me a complete layout of this building complex. How do I get to the War Room? Now listen to me. I'm trying to help you. To save your life and the lives of millions like you. If you help me, maybe I can do it. If you don't, you'll die, we'll die, and the killing will go on. Or are you that fond of the war? We're going to try and stop the killing. We're trying to help. Believe me. Tell me what I want to know. Please. I didn't come to drink. A very efficient weapon. I'm not afraid of using it. I am? We're less cold-blooded about it than you are. I want to contact my ship. Where are my communicators? You take a lot of chances, Councilman. If I were you, I'd think about saving my life. I'm not interested in discussing our differences. You don't seem to realise the risk you're taking. We don't make war with computers and herd the casualties into suicide stations. We make the real thing, Councilman. I could destroy this planet.

Thank you, Mister Painter. Mister Spock, equip a landing party of five to accompany me to the planet's surface. Include Doctor McCoy and a biologist. I'll want them in ten minutes.

Naturally, you'll inform your people to begin preparations. We will have accommodations for you aboard the Enterprise. It's not an arbitrary decision on my part. I have my orders.

Report back to me at the settlement in ten minutes. We're evacuating all colonists to Starbase Twenty Seven. You don't think so, what? Spock, report to me immediately. Spock? Acknowledge. Spock.

It simply has not yet been discovered. There is no current volcanic activity on this planet, Captain. Oh. You mean shot at it. Fascinating. Mister Vanderberg, what is this? But a geological oddity, to say the least. Pure silicon? I've charted the positions of the deaths and acts of sabotage. Here, here, and here. If the times of these incidents are to be accepted as accurate, the creature would have to have moved at an incredible rate of speed. If we could force another appearance of this creature I wouldn't touch it, Captain. An extremely active corrosive. Traces may linger. The same indication as shown at the door, Captain. A very strong corrosive. Nothing for a device this antiquated, Captain. The missing pump wasn't taken by accident. It was the one piece of equipment absolutely essential for the operation of the reactor. It would seem so. I don't know. But there is a possibility. Life as we know it is universally based on some combination of carbon compounds, but what if life exists based on another element? For instance, silicon. Certainly not phaser one, which is far less powerful than phaser two. It could explain much, especially since the colonists are armed only with phaser one. Which I could adjust to be more effective against silicon. It may be, Doctor, that the creature can exist for brief periods in such an atmosphere before returning to its own environment. Yes, Captain. You recall that Vanderberg commented there were thousands of these at a lower level, the level which the machinery opened just prior to the first appearance of the creature. I don't know. I have already given Doctor McCoy sufficient cause for amusement. I'd prefer to cogitate the possibilities for a time. Captain, the security officers have gathered in Chief Vanderberg's office. Mister Vanderberg, may I ask at which level you discovered the nodules of silicon? Adjusting my tricorder to register for silicon, Captain. Interesting. A life form, Captain. Bearing one hundred eleven degrees, elevation four degrees. No, sir. Silicon. He never even had a chance to fire, Captain. Captain. This tunnel. My readings indicate it was made within the hour. Moments ago, in fact. Positive. Indeed, Captain. I'm quite at a loss. Disappeared. Astonishing that anything of that bulk could move so rapidly. Indeed. This tunnel was cut within the last two minutes. Readings indicate a maze of tunnels of this general category in that direction. The closest approximation I could come to would be fibrous asbestos. A mineral, Captain. It would seem so. Silicon-based. We are dealing with a silicon creature of the deep rocks, capable of moving through solid rock as easily as we move through the air. Correct. This creature's body secretes an extremely powerful corrosive. And it explains the murdered men. Or a single phaser with much longer contact. I've run a complete spherical check on all life forms, radius one hundred miles. I've located our men, all of them, and I've located one creature moving rapidly through native rock, bearing two hundred and one. And that is all. Exactly. Captain, there are literally thousands of these tunnels in this general area alone, far too many to be cut by the one creature in an ordinary lifetime. Or it is the last of a race of creatures which made these tunnels. If so, if it is the only survivor of a dead race, to kill it would be a crime against science. I see no alternative myself, Captain. It merely seems a pity. The search team is gathering in the main tunnel. Gentlemen, if you'll examine your charts, please. I last located the creature in the area marked adit26 moving in bearing two zero one. This particular group will move out beyond that area in all directions in an effort to surround it, and possibly capture it. You did not, sir. I merely thought that if the opportunity arose Very well, sir. II beg your pardon, sir? Is not needed there, sir. Mister Scott has far more knowledge of nuclear reactors than I do. You're aware of that. Captain, there are approximately one hundred of us engaged in this search, against one creature. The odds against you and I both being killed are 2,228.7 to 1. And they are of course accurate, Captain. That is always my intention, Captain. Captain, we are being watched. No, sir. We're being watched. Captain. Fresh readings within the hour in each of these tunnels. Should we separate? Yes, Captain. Indeed? I find that most illuminating, Captain. Be absolutely certain you do not damage any of them. Only a theory I have. Captain? Are you all right? Jim? Jim! I could phaser you out. Very well, but I find it extremely disquieting that your roof chose that particular moment to collapse. Please proceed with extreme caution. I shall quicken my pace. Captain, I just read some fresh signs. The creature is in this area. I'll take a lifeform reading. Where, Captain? Kill it, Captain, quickly. You don't dare take the chance, Captain. Kill it. Jim, your life is in danger. You can't take the risk. I remind you it's a proven killer. I'm on my way. Spock out. Fascinating. It's made no moves against you? Yes, I see. Possibly the answer, Captain, but I'm not certain. Captain, you are aware of the Vulcan technique of the joining of two minds. It's possible. I'll try. Pain! Pain! Pain! That's all I got, Captain. Waves and waves of searing pain. It's in agony. I don't know, Captain. Evidently, it gained an immediate knowledge of us from its empathy with me. In my brief contact with the creature's mind, I discovered it is a highly intelligent, extremely sophisticated animal. In great pain, of course, because of its wound, but not reacting at all like a wounded creature. It calls itself a Horta. Captain, it has no reason to give us the device, and apparently every reason for wishing us off this planet. Jim, I remind you that this is a silicon-based form of life. Doctor McCoy's medical knowledge will be totally useless. To obtain that kind of communication, Captain, it will be necessary to touch it. Murder. Of thousands. Devils! Eternity ends. The chamber of the ages. The altar of tomorrow! Murderers! Stop them. Kill! Strike back! Monsters! The end of life. Murderers. Understood. It is the end of life. Eternity stops. Go out into the tunnel. To the chamber of the ages. Cry for the children. Walk carefully in the vault of tomorrow. Sorrow for the murdered children. The thing you search for is there. Go. Go. Sadness. Sadness for the end of things. Go into the tunnel. There is a passageway. Quickly, quickly. It is time to sleep. It is over. Failure. The murderers have won. Death is welcome. Let it end here. Yes, Captain, eggs and about to hatch. There have been many generations of Horta on this planet. Every fifty thousand years, the entire race dies, all but one, like this one, but the eggs live. She cares for them, protects them. And when they hatch, she is the mother to them, thousands of them. This creature here is the mother of her race. And they are the most inoffensive of creatures. They harbour ill will towards no one. Except for one thing. The Horta is badly wounded. It may die. It seems logical, Captain. The Horta has a very logical mind. And after close association with humans, I find that curiously refreshing. Ship ready to leave orbit, Captain. Course laid in. Chief Engineer Vanderberg standing by on channel one. Curious. What Chief Vanderberg said about the Horta is exactly what the Mother Horta said to me. She found humanoid appearance revolting, but she thought she could get used to it. Not specifically, but I did get the distinct impression she found them the most attractive human characteristic of all. I didn't have the heart to tell her that only I have Captain, the Horta is a remarkably intelligent and sensitive creature, with impeccable taste. Really, Captain, my modesty Captain, I see no reason to stand here and be insulted.",98

The Organians raided the game.""]","Good. We both guessed right. Negotiations with the Klingon Empire are on the verge of breaking down. Starfleet Command anticipates a surprise attack. We are to proceed to Organia and take whatever steps are necessary to prevent the Klingons from using it as a base. Organia's description, Mister Spock. Another Armenia, Belgium. The weak innocents who always seem to be located on the natural invasion routes. Configuration, Mister Sulu. Phaser banks, lock on. Return fire. Maintain firing rate. One hundred percent dispersal pattern. Damage control, report to the first officer. All hands, maintain general alert. Hold battle stations. Damage report, Mister Spock. Maintain surveillance, Mister Sulu. Well, we've been anticipating an attack. I'd say what we've just experienced very nearly qualifies. Well, there it is. War. We didn't want it, but we've got it. War or not, we've still got a job to do. Denying Organia to the Klingons. Lay in a course for Organia, Mister Sulu. We won't get it by talking about it. The trigger's been pulled. We have to get there before the hammer falls. Ahead warp factor seven. What bearing? Mister Sulu, have the phaser crews stand by their positions. Full power deflector screens. Mister Spock and I are going to the planet's surface. You will be in command. Your responsibility is to the Enterprise, not to us. Is that clear? The Klingon fleet is in this quadrant. We know that Organia will be a target. If they should emerge You will evaluate the situation. If there is a fleet of them, you'll get out of here, Mister Sulu. No buts. You'll get to safety and alert the fleet. You will not attack alone. Mister Spock and I will be all right. Mister Spock, let's you and I pay the Organians a visit. You'd think they had people beaming down every day. Yes. A fortress, perhaps. A castle. Reception committee? I am Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the United Federation of Planets. This is my first officer Mister Spock. I would like to speak to someone in authority. You people are in great danger. Is there someplace we can go and talk? Gentlemen, my government has informed me that the Klingons are expected to move against your planet with the objective of making it a base of operation against the Federation. My mission, frankly, is to keep them from doing it. No, sir. With the Federation, you have a choice. You have none with the Klingons. The Klingons are a military dictatorship. War is their way of life. Life under the Klingon rule would be very unpleasant. We offer you protection. You have this planet and its strategic location. I assure you that if you don't take action to prevent it, the Klingons will move against you as surely as your sun rises. We will help you build defences, build facilities. Gentlemen, I have seen what the Klingons do to planets like yours. They are organised into vast slave labour camps. No freedoms whatsoever. Your goods will be confiscated. Hostages taken and killed, your leaders confined. You'd be far better off on a penal planet. Infinitely better off. You keep insisting there's no danger. I keep assuring you there is. Would you mind telling me That's the first thing that would be lost! Excuse me, gentlemen. I'm a soldier, not a diplomat. I can only tell you the truth. Certainly. That doesn't seem likely. Thank you, Mister Spock. That might be useful. Gentlemen, I must get you to reconsider. We can be of immense help to you. In addition to military aid, we can send you specialists, technicians. We can show you how to feed a thousand people where one was fed before. We can help you build schools, educate the young in the latest technological and scientific skills. Your public facilities are almost non-existent. We can help you remake your world, end disease, hunger, hardship. All we ask in return is that you let us help you. Now. Excuse me, sir. Kirk here. Positive identification? Mister Sulu, follow your orders. Get out of here. Contact the fleet. Return if the odds are more equal. Kirk out. Gentlemen, you kept insisting that there was no danger Can you verify that? If you had listened to me How does he know that? So we're stranded here, in the middle of a Klingon occupation army. You have a gift for understatement, Mister Spock. It's not a very pleasant prospect at all. Did you take them? I must ask you to return them. They know that Vulcan is a member of the Federation. What about the rest of you? You have a lot to learn, sir. And if I know the Klingons, you'll be learning it the hard way. I have a tongue. My what? He's no spy. He's done nothing. Nothing at all. You're here. There's nothing I can do about it. You need my approval? You seem to be in command. Me? I don't want the job. And Mister Spock? He is my friend. I don't understand. And you're proud of it. Are you sure you're all right? Or I will be killed. That mindsifter can't be all the terror they think it is. I'll try and avoid it. You didn't really think I was going to beat his head in, did you? You're right. But as you say, we still have a job to do. Maybe, but sooner or later they'll start resenting how the Klingons run things. If we could prove to them they could do something to strike back, to keep the Klingons off balance. That's exactly what I had in mind. Mister Spock Did I or did I not see something that looked like a munitions dump outside of Kor's headquarters? I think it's time we did a little simple and plain communicating. Tonight. We're short of tools. Okay so far. Sonic grenade? You were right, Mister Spock. A most satisfactory display. Of course we blew it up. Deliberately. We did it to show you that you can fight back. You don't have to be sheep, you can be wolves. History is full of examples of civil populations fighting back successfully against a military dictatorship. We may not be able to destroy the Klingons, but we can tie them up. Blow up their installations, disrupt their communications, make Organia useless to them. Why? Are you afraid of retribution? Does your personal freedom mean so little to you? All I understand is that you apparently don't have the backbone to fight and protect your loved ones. I speak of courage, gentlemen. Does courage mean so little to you? Ayelborne! I'm used to the idea of dying, but I have no desire to die for the likes of you. No, thank you. What do you want from me? You think I'm going to sit here and just talk with the enemy? Something was destroyed? Nothing inconsequential, I hope. We're nothing like you. We're a democratic body. It's a very large universe, Commander, full of people who don't like the Klingons. It will take a lot longer than that, Commander. How much of the twelve hours do we have left? I think we can count on them being punctual. Blowing that munitions dump wasn't enough. If we get out of here, we've got to carry the attack directly to Kor. These Organians Nevertheless, our orders still stand. We've got to make some attempt to neutralise the Klingon occupation. And there are guards every few feet down the hall. Go? You turned us over to them. You expect us to trust you now? We can't stay here. This is the first place they'll look. First you turn us in, then get us out. What are you doing now, waiting for the Klingons to post a reward so you can turn us in again and collect it? What happened to them? Is that's all you can do, smile? I want to know how I'm free, and why. This idiotic placidity of yours, your refusal to do anything to protect yourselves Those are Klingon phasers. Take the door. Get down, gentlemen. Did you hear them? Well, Mister Spock. It seems it's up to you and me. The Federation has invested a great deal of money in our training. They're about due for a small return. We have two hours with which to do it in. No. No more will die on account of us, Mister Spock. Where are those phasers? You've told us a great deal about how you hate violence. Unless you tell me where those phasers are, you're going to have more violence than you know what to do with. It's entirely up to you. Gentlemen, I have no great love for you, your planet, your culture. Despite that, Mister Spock and I are going to go out there and quite probably die, in an attempt to show you that there are some things worth dying for. Come on, Mister Spock, let's get out of here. Mister Spock, can we get those two guards? What would you say the odds on our getting out of here? Difficult to be precise? 7,824 to 1? That's a pretty close approximation. You do quite well. Set your phaser on stun. We're after the top dog, not the members of the pack. But if the situation calls for it, we kill, is that clear? I'll take the one on the left. Fire. If you don't tell me what I want to know, I'll kill you here and now. Is that clear? Is Kor's office down there? What about the hostages? Talk. Talk. To be killed? Mister Spock. Well, what are the odds now? Less than seven thousand to one. Well, getting better. Getting better. Just stay where you are, Commander. Checkmate, Commander. I don't intend to kill you unless I have to. Cover, Spock! Back! What is it, Spock? You are stopping this? You? Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. Stand by, Sulu. What have you done? You're talking nonsense. You can't just stop the fleet. What gives you the right? We have legitimate grievances against the Klingons. They've invaded our territory, killed our citizens. They're openly aggressive. They've boasted that they'll take over half the galaxy. You're the ones who issued the ultimatum to withdraw from the disputed areas! You should be the first to be on our side. Two hundred hostages killed. Even if you have some power that we don't understand, you have no right to dictate to our Federation How to handle their interstellar relations! We have the right Well, no one wants war. But there are proper channels. People have a right to handle their own affairs. Eventually, we will have What do you mean, beings like yourselves? But what about this planet? The fields, the buildings, this citadel? Well, Commander, I guess that takes care of the war. Obviously, the Organians aren't going to let us fight. I'm embarrassed. I was furious with the Organians for stopping a war I didn't want. We think of ourselves as the most powerful beings in the universe. It's unsettling to discover that we're wrong. Oh, no, no, no, Mister Spock, We didn't beat the odds. We didn't have a chance. The Organians raided the game.",144

Iron-silicon base, oxygen-hydrogen atmosphere, largely arid, no discernible life. No surprises. Captain. Incredible, Captain. What my instruments read is totally unbelievable, Captain. Twice, for a split second each time, everything within range of our instruments seemed on the verge of winking out. I have given you the facts, Captain. The entire magnetic field in this solar system simply blinked. The planet below, the mass of which we're measuring, attained zero gravity. Is non-existence. Captain, scanners now report a life object on the planet surface below. Inexplicable, Captain. This reading began at approximately the moment that the pulsation phenomenon began to subside. A living being. Body temperature 98.5 Fahrenheit. Mass, electrical impulses, movement. It is apparently human, Captain. None. Possible. Very possible. Negative, Captain. Scanners indicate situation normal. Nothing. Illogical. An effect of such proportions, unexplainable by any established physical laws that I'm aware of. I have been able to ascertain one fact. Though the effect, whatever it was, was unquestioningly widespread, it was strongest here on the planet beneath us. Third, a closer examination of the planet's surface would be in order. My job, sir? Negative, Captain. Anything from our guest? Lieutenant Uhura communicated that information. I ordered re-confirmation on our sensors. They indicate no living creature on this planet. I suggest, Captain, that you've been lied to. I fail to comprehend your indignation, sir. I've simply made the logical deduction that you are a liar. I'm trying, Captain. Captain, readings of the effect indicate it centred here on this planet, almost on this very spot. Negative, Captain. I can no more explain the occurrence of the second phenomenon than I can the first. That a single creature, a humanoid could be responsible for an effect of such magnitude? Indeed. Affirmative. Captain, I only know for certain that the occurrence of the phenomenon coincides exactly with the moments that Lazarus has his alleged confrontations. Request you come to the Bridge, Captain. Something quite extraordinary. Main screen on, Lieutenant. Source of radiation, Captain. Because it is not there. What I mean, Captain, is that according to our usual scanning procedures, there is nothing there that could be causing that effect. Affirmative. I confess I am somewhat at a loss for words. It may be described, though loosely and inaccurately, as a rip in our universe. A kind of physical warp, Captain, in which none of our established physical laws apply with any regularity. However, with the dilithium crystals, I was able to localise it. You refer to the humanoid? Why does he need the crystals? For what reason? Unable to locate the source of radiation. It has simply disappeared, Captain. True, Captain, but more significant to me is the fact that our ship's instruments are specifically designed to locate and identify any object in our universe, be it energy or matter. Correct. Which would seem to be impossible. Perfect working condition. Nor in our universe, Captain. It came from outside. The possible existence of a parallel universe has been scientifically conceded, Captain. Unquestionably a warp. A distortion of physical laws on an immense scale. Indeed. I point out that a hole in the universe or in a simple container can either allow the contents to escape There has been no evidence of a large-scale invasion. Difficult, Captain. One moment, paranoid, the next, calm, mild, rational. Almost as if he were two men. Through which these two beings are somehow enabled to pass. The cut on his forehead.

Captain, in three weeks at this rate, possibly a month, I might reach the first mnemonic memory circuits. I am endeavouring, ma'am, to construct a mnemonic memory circuit using stone knives and bearskins. Captain. Tools for finely detailed work. I needed the fine tools for my radio work. They'd have been returned in the morning. Interesting. Where would you estimate we belong, Miss Keeler? I'll finish with the furnace. I may have found our focal point in time. Yes. I'm overloading those lines. I believe we'll have our answer on this screen, Captain. And, Captain, you may find this a bit distressing. I've slowed down the recording we made from the time vortex. Bad enough. It would seem unlikely, Jim. A few moments ago, I read a 1930 newspaper article. Or Captain, Edith Keeler will die this year. I saw her obituary. Some sort of traffic accident. Captain, Edith Keeler is the focal point in time we've been looking for, the point that both we and Doctor McCoy have been drawn to. Is the random element. Or perhaps he prevents her from being killed. We don't know which. Captain, suppose we discover that in order to set things straight again, Edith Keeler must die? I'll need at least two more days before I dare make another attempt. Captain, our last bit of information was obtained at the expense of thirty hours work in fused and burned circuits. This is how history went after McCoy changed it. Here, in the late 1930s. A growing pacifist movement whose influence delayed the United States' entry into the Second World War. While peace negotiations dragged on, Germany had time to complete its heavy-water experiments. Because all this lets them develop the A-bomb first. There's no mistake, Captain. Let me run it again. Edith Keeler. Founder of the peace movement. She was right, but at the wrong time. With the A-bomb, and with their V2 rockets to carry them, Germany captured the world. And all this because McCoy came back and somehow kept her from dying in a street accident as she was meant to. We must stop him, Jim. We can estimate general happenings from these images, but I can't trace down precise actions at exact moments, Captain. I'm sorry. Jim, Edith Keeler must die. Captain, I did not plan to eavesdrop. I must point out that when she stumbled, she might have died right there, had you not caught her. We're not that sure of our facts. Who's to say when the exact time will come? Save her, do as your heart tells you to do, and millions will die who did not die before. What is it? No, Jim! He knows, Doctor. He knows. We were successful.",74

Not only should it have been destroyed by our phasers, it does not even register on my tricorder. It is not life as we know or understand it. Yet t is obviously alive, it exists. Captain, I suggest we risk taking it aboard. No! No! No, I won't. I must take the ship. Down! I must take it down. Doctor McCoy. Captain. These restraints will no longer be necessary. Nor will your sedatives, Doctor. I'll be able to return to duty. I apologise for my weakness earlier when I tried to take control of the ship. I simply did not understand. I am a Vulcan, Doctor. Pain is a thing of the mind. The mind can be controlled. It is proving to be an inconvenience, but it is manageable. And the creature, with all of its thousands of parts, even now is pressuring me. It wants this ship, but I am resisting. I have my own will, Captain. Let me help. I am a Vulcan. I am a Vulcan. There is no pain. I was. I have an errand on the planet's surface. You will beam me down to the same co-ordinates as before. That is an order, Mister Scott. Until the pain was gone, Captain. It has been discontinued by me. One of the creatures will have to be captured and analysed, Captain. We did not have a clear opportunity to do so earlier when I was attacked. Since my nervous system is already affected, as you pointed out, Doctor, I don't believe they can do much more to me. I am in complete control of myself, Doctor. The fact that I am here proves that I do not belong in bed. Thank you, Captain. Come in, gentlemen. I believe you'll find this interesting. Doctor, your medical skill and curiosity are quite admirable, but I assure you I'm all right. Unimportant at the moment, Doctor. Please observe. Interesting, gentlemen. A one-celled creature resembling, more than anything else, a huge, individual brain cell. Do you understand what I'm suggesting, Captain? And although it is not physically connected to the other cells, it is nevertheless part of the whole creature, guided by the whole, drawing its strength from the whole, which probably accounts for its unusual resistance to our phaser weapons. From a place where our physical laws do not apply. We may therefore find it difficult to destroy, Captain. Yes, sir. I regret I see no other choice for you, Captain. We already know this thing has destroyed three civilisations. Perhaps more. Including myself, Doctor, and Captain Kirk's young nephew. Understandably upsetting, but once it spreads past here, there are dozens of colonies beyond and billions of people. I therefore request permission to beam down to the planet's surface. I also suggest that your nephew accompany me. Captain, I do not make this request lightly. I do not know how much longer I can hold out against the pain. But I do know what the boy will go through should he regain consciousness. It exists physically. It occupies space. It has mass, therefore gravity. It converts matter to energy. A possibility. Yes. In essence, it can be done. A string of satellites around the planet with burning tri-magnesite and trevium. Of course. The light of the sun at the proximity where the Denevan declared himself free was one million candles per square inch. If this works, the satellites we orbit will produce light of such intensity that even someone in a closed, darkened area will be affected by it. Captain, you'll need a host for the next step in the test to determine whether the creature can be driven from the body. I am the logical choice. There'll be none on the planet's surface, Doctor. The creature within me is gone. I am free of it and the pain. And I'm also quite blind. An equitable trade, Doctor. Thank you. Interesting. Just as dogs are sensitive to certain sounds which humans cannot hear, these creatures evidently are sensitive to light which we cannot see. Doctor it was my selection as well. It is done. An hereditary trait, Captain. The brightness of the Vulcan sun has caused the development of an inner eyelid, which acts as a shield against high-intensity light. Totally instinctive, Doctor. We tend to ignore it, as you ignore your own appendix. Quite the contrary, Captain. I had a very strong reaction. My first sight was the face of Doctor McCoy bending over me. My pleasure, Captain. Why, thank you, Doctor McCoy.",61

Let's go mind the store.""]","A minute. No, nothing in particular. Why ? That just sounds like Mister Spock in one of his contemplative phases. Bones, I'm a busy man. Spock said that? Spock, what the devil is this all about? All right, Spock, let's have it. I'm more interested in your request for shore leave. In all the years In all the years that I've known you, you've never asked for a leave of any sort. In fact, you've refused them. Why now? Agreed, but that isn't the question, is it? If there's a problem of some sort, illness in the family Then since we're headed for Altair Six, and since the shore facilities there are excellent Spock, I'm asking you. What's wrong? Bridge. Helm. Alter course to Vulcan. Increase speed to warp four. I suppose most of us overlook the fact that even Vulcans aren't indestructible. Put it on audio over here, Lieutenant. Lieutenant Uhura, acknowledge that message. Mister Chekov, compute course and speed necessary for compliance. Head directly for Altair Six. Sailor's luck, Mister Spock. Or, as one of Finagle's Laws puts it, 'Any home port the ship makes ill be somebody else's, not mine'. The new president of Altair Six wants to get himself launched a week early, so we have to be there a week early. Don't worry. I'll see that you get your leave as soon as we're finished. Bridge. Navigation. Mister Chekov, how late will we arrive for the ceremonies if we increase speed to maximum and divert to Vulcan just long enough to drop off Mister Spock? How far behind schedule will diverting to Vulcan put us? Thank you, Mister Chekov. Kirk, out. Mister Spock. Come with me, please. Deck five. You've changed course for Vulcan, Mister Spock. Why? Do you deny it? Then why'd you do it? I'm trying to help you, Spock. I order you to report to the Sickbay. Complete examination. McCoy's waiting. Bones, I will, I will. As soon as this mission is Why must he die? Why within eight days? Explain. You keep saying that. Are you a doctor, or aren't you? You say you're convinced he knows what it is? Stay. McCoy has given me his medical evaluation of your condition. He says you're going to die unless something is done. What? Is it something only your planet can do for you? Spock! You've been called the best first officer in the fleet. That's an enormous asset to me. If I have to lose that first officer, I want to know why. No, I do not understand. Explain. Consider that an order. Would it help if I told you that I'll treat this as totally confidential? What? What kind of biology? You mean the biology of Vulcans? Biology as in reproduction? Well, there's no need to be embarrassed about it, Mister Spock. It happens to the birds and the bees. I guess the rest of us assume that it's done quite logically. But you're not a fish, Mister Spock. You're I haven't heard a word you've said, and I'll get you to Vulcan somehow. Lieutenant, get me Admiral Komack at Starfleet Command, Sector Nine. Pipe it down to McCoy's office. I'm aware of that, sir, but it's of the utmost importance. You must give me permission to divert to Vulcan. I can't, sir, but believe me, I wouldn't make such a request Sir, the delay would be, at most, a day. I can hardly believe that No, it's not. I know the Altair situation. We would be one of three starships. Very impressive, very diplomatic, but it's simply not that vital. I can't let Spock die, can I, Bones? And he will if we go to Altair. I owe him my life a dozen times over. Isn't that worth a career? He's my friend. Bridge. Navigation. Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Vulcan. Tell Engineering I want warp eight or better. Push her for all she'll take. I see. Very well. Carry on, Mister Chekov. Kirk, out. Bridge. Will I? You've been most patient with my kinds of madness. Is it permitted? Thank you, Mister Spock. Open the channel, Lieutenant. Vulcan Space Central, this is the USS Enterprise requesting permission to assume standard orbit. He described it to me as meaning marriage or challenge. In the distant past, Vulcans killed to win their mates. It's lovely. I wish the breeze were cooler. The atmosphere is thinner than Earth. Marriage party? You said T'Pring was your wife. Bones, you know who that is? T'Pau. The only person to ever turn down a seat on the Federation Council. He never mentioned that his family was this important. Ma'am. What is it? What happened? Spock? We'll stay. Think Spock can take him? What happens to Spock if I decline? I can't? And you said Spock might not be able to handle him. If I can knock Spock out without really hurting him If I get into any trouble, I'll quit. And Spock wins, and honour is satisfied. Bones. He's my first officer and my friend. I disregarded Starfleet orders to bring him here. Another thing, that's T'Pau of Vulcan. All of Vulcan in one package. How can I back out in front of her? I accept the challenge. What do you mean, if both survive? Now wait a minute, ma'am. Who said anything about a fight to the death? Kill Spock? That's not what I came to Vulcan for, is it? What's that? Sound medical advice. Don't you think you better check with me first? Blame McCoy. That was no tri-ox compound he shot me with. He slipped in a neural paralyser. Knocked me out, simulated death. Kirk here. Relay it, Lieutenant. Well, a little late, but I'm glad they're seeing it our way. How about that T'Pau? They couldn't turn her down. Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Altair Six.

A projection? Hard about. Reverse all engines. Lieutenant, relay our position and circumstances to Starbase Twelve immediately. Mister Sulu try rocking the ship. Full impulse power forward and back. Thank you. Mister Sulu? Mister Spock. Status. Thank you. Mister Sulu. Our forward tractor beams, adjust to repel. Activate. Let's all take a look at it, Mister Spock. Response frequencies, Lieutenant. This is Captain James T. Kirk, commanding the USS Enterprise. Please identify yourself. Are you responsible for stopping the ship? Give it back, then we'll talk. I don't know who or what you are, but I must warn you we have the power to defend ourselves. If you value your safety, release this ship. Never mind the history lesson. Release the ship! Compensate. All right! Whatever you're doing, turn it off! You win! Let's go, Bones. You in good voice? If we don't accept his invitation, we'll have a crushed eggshell where this ship used to be. Insulted, Spock? Good. We'll tackle him together. We already know the questions. You're the best man to find the answers. Tricorders. Come on. You know of Earth? You've been there? You mentioned Agamemnon, Hector, Odysseus. How do you know about them? Mister Chekov. And you haven't yet. Readings, Doctor. Evidently not so simple. All right. We're here at your invitation. Would you mind telling us what you want without all the Olympian generalities? Transporter room. Enterprise, come in. What is it you want? If you want to play god and call yourself Apollo, that's your business, but you're no god to us, Mister. And you've got a lot to learn! Analysis. Lieutenant Palamas, what do you know about Apollo? And this thing? I think the appearance of this is for our benefit. Bones? Fine, but what power, and where is it? Scout around with your tricorders. Find the source of that power. Bones. Bones, I wonder if five thousand years ago I have an idea. What if he is really Apollo? Apollo, we're willing to talk, but you'll find we don't bow to every creature who happens to have a bag of tricks. I have four hundred and thirty people on that ship up there. Scotty. Very impressive. How'd you do it? Bones, how is he? He would have been rather difficult to stop. Mister Chekov, I think you'd better continue your investigation. How do you feel, Scotty? It would seem so. Mister Scott, I understand your concern over her, but she volunteered to go with him, hopefully to find out more about him. She's doing her job. I think it's about time you started doing yours. We've got to find out the source of his power. You've got a tricorder. Use it if you're able to. And one more thing. I want no more unauthorised action against Apollo or whatever he is. That's an order! Besides, you stiff-necked thistle head, you could have gotten yourself killed. Apollo's no god. But he could have been taken for one, though, once. Say five thousand years ago, a highly sophisticated group of space travellers landed on Earth around the Mediterranean. Especially if they had the power to alter their form at will and command great energy. In fact, they couldn't have been taken for anything else. I've just picked up readings for our own people, sir. Apollo has no difficulty focusing. He taps that energy, Mister Scott. Are you suggesting that he, Apollo, taps a flow of energy and channels it through his body? Mister Chekov, I think you've earned your pay for the week. But where is the source of that power? Is that all you have to offer? Bones, is it possible Where's Lieutenant Palamas? Scotty! All right, mister. You wanted worshippers? You've got enemies. You want us to bow down, you'll have to Take care of Scotty. Where's Apollo? Don't you mean the English story, the Cheshire Cat? All right, all right, all right. Very good, Mister Chekov. That might very well mean something. We've got to get out of here. Well, let's assume that five thousand years ago creatures like our friend Apollo did indeed visit Earth and form the basis of the Greek classic myths. Most mythology has its basis in fact. If I remember my ancient legends, the gods, after expending energy, required rest, even as we humans. Something like that. Remember, he's keeping a force field on the ship and he's expending energy down here. You said he looked pained and tired when he disappeared. If we can wear him out, overwork him, that might do it. If we can provoke him so that he strikes one of us again, there's a chance that he'll be drained enough so the rest of us can jump him. Not all of us, Bones. When he comes back, it's a chance we'll have to take. You know nothing about our kind. You know only our remote ancestors who trembled before your tricks. Your tricks don't frighten us, neither do you. We've come a long way in five thousand years. Mankind has no need for gods. We find the one quite adequate. We're busy. Look after the girl. Go! Gather laurel leaves? You must be joking! Lieutenant, get back. We're tired of your phony fireworks! Lieutenant! Lieutenant! Lieutenant. And you will supply the herds of sheep, and the pipes we'll play, and the simple skins we'll wear for clothes. We were doing something until our brave lady stepped in and saved us. Yes, I have. One more. And it depends on the lieutenant's loyalty. If she fails us, we'd better get used to herding goats. Kirk to Enterprise, come in. Enterprise, come in. Kirk to Enterprise, come in. Kirk to Scotty, I'll find out. How old are you? Then I'd better handle it. You all right? Come over there. Well? All right, Lieutenant, you can come down from Mount Olympus now. You've got work to do. He thrives on love, worship, attention. We can't give him that worship, none of us can. Especially you. Spurn him. Reject him. You must. You're special to him. Lieutenant. All our lives, here and on the ship, depend on you. On you, Lieutenant! Reject him, and we have a chance to save ourselves. Accept him, and you condemn all of us to slavery, nothing less than slavery. We might never get help this far out. Or perhaps the thought of spending an eternity bending knee and tending sheep appeals to you. Give me your hand. Your hand. Now feel that. Human flesh against human flesh. We're the same. We share the same history, the same heritage, the same lives. We're tied together beyond any untying. Man or woman, it makes no difference. We're human. We couldn't escape from each other even if we wanted to. That's how you do it, Lieutenant. By remembering who and what you are. A bit of flesh and blood afloat in a universe without end. The only thing that's truly yours is the rest of humanity. That's where our duty lies. Do you understand me? Lieutenant. You have your orders and your duty. Kirk here. There is indeed, Mister Spock. Very good. How are you doing on the force field? Well, that ought to do it. Have Sulu lock all phaser banks onto the structure. Fire on my order only. Cut it fine. We'll be standing nearby. I'd love to oblige you, Mister Spock, but we're not all together. Besides, we have Apollo to deal with. If that structure is the source of his power, I want to know where he is when we attack it. Kirk out. Bones, do you think that mysterious organ in Apollo's chest could have something to do with the transmission of energy? Yes, I know. I know. Scotty. We'll wait. Kirk here. Stand by your phasers, Mister Spock. Prepare to fire on my signal. Kirk out. We've got to be here when he comes back. Scotty, just hold on! All right. The temple is his power source. Let's bring him back to it. Get to cover. Mister Spock, fire those phasers. Fire those phasers! That's an order, Mister Spock! Scotty! We've out grown you. You asked for something we could no longer give. So do I. They gave us so much. The Greek civilisation, much of our culture and philosophy came from a worship of those beings. In a way, they began the Golden Age. Would it have hurt us, I wonder, just to have gathered a few laurel leaves?",127

They have to answer. That can't be. The last census reported a total inhabitation of more than four billion people. That's impossible. What could have happened? Any other possibilities? Evasive manoeuvres, Mister Sulu. Full power to the shields, Mister Scott. All hands, Red Alert. Phaser banks stand by. Photon torpedoes to Condition Red, Condition Red. Good. Ninety? I think we can expect others, Lieutenant. Mister Spock, pinpoint the source. Mister Sulu, evasive manoeuvres. Lieutenant, contact Starfleet Command. Patch in my log. Tell them what has happened. Tell them the entire Malurian race seems to have been destroyed by an unknown agency, and that we are under attack by an unidentified force. Helmsmen, I said evasive manoeuvres. Scotty? Mister Spock, speed of those bolts. Then we can't out run them. Good, Scotty. You're doing the right thing. Source, Spock. That's our target, Mister Sulu. Prepare photon torpedo. Has the target changed location, Mister Spock? Ready photon torpedo number two, Mister Sulu. Fire. Absorbed it? There must be damage to your instruments, Spock . But what could have absorbed that much energy and survived? Lieutenant, try to make contact. Can we take it, Mister Scott? Anything, Lieutenant? Translator computer. All hailing frequencies open. To unidentified vessel. This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. We are on a peaceful mission. We mean no harm to you or any lifeforms. Please communicate with us. Any further readings, Mister Spock? Five hundred kilos and only one metre long? Put it on audio, Lieutenant. Analysis sector. Have them study and decode it. Can you decode it? Repeat what? The message I sent? This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. We are on a peaceful mission in this part of the galaxy. We have no hostile intentions. We request identity. Tie in the ship's translator to the communication channel. Let them take it at their own speed. I guess they can take it faster than we give it. Apparently they got what they needed before the computers burned out. It is impossible to come aboard your ship because of the size differential. We are prepared to beam you aboard our ship. Do you require any special conditions, any particular atmosphere or environment? Good. Hold your position. We're locked onto your co-ordinates. We'll beam you aboard. Do we have any choice, Scotty? Besides, once it's aboard, it won't be taking any more shots at us. Lieutenant, get a repair crew on that computer. Get Doctor McCoy down to the transporter room. Spock, you come with me. Scotty, you too. Energise. Sensor readings, Mister Spock. We are from the United Federation of Planets. If we show it a close-up view of our system, it has no point of reference. It won't know more than it does now. If you care to leave your ship, we'll provide the necessary life support systems. Wasn't there a probe called Nomad launched in the early 2000s? I will bring them. This way. Now, Scotty, get our warp power up to full capacity. Spock, Bones, come with us. 14A. Nomad, can you scan that? This is our point of origin, the star we know as Sol. Yes. Yes. Yes. What sterilisation procedure? Yes, he is. Sometimes, but tell him your function nevertheless. Biological infestation. There was never any probe sent out for that. Did you destroy the Malurian system? Doctor. Why do you call me the creator? Well, I Mister Singh. Come here a moment. This unit will see to your needs. I'll be back in a moment. Gentlemen, come with me. You're on to something, Spock. What is it? Nomad was destroyed. I heard some lectures at the Academy on the Nomad probe. Its mission was essentially peaceful. Jackson Roykirk. Captain James Kirk. What do we have on Nomad itself, Spock? Its purpose was certainly altered. Its directive, to seek out and destroy biological infestations, could not have been programmed into it. If what you say is true, then we've taken aboard our vessel a device which sooner or later must destroy us. Security. This is the captain. The mechanism we brought aboard is in the auxiliary control room. Have a security team meet me there in five minutes. Security, cancel that order. Implement a full search for the mechanism. All decks report to me here. Captain here. On my way, Scotty. Scotty! Bones. Why did you kill him? That unit was my Chief Engineer. Lieutenant. Lieutenant, are you all right? Sickbay. What did you do to her? Get Scott down below. He's dead. His biological functions have ceased. All right, Nomad. Repair the unit. It serves me as it is, Nomad. Repair it. Doctor McCoy will show you. Security. I want a twenty four hour, two man armed surveillance on Nomad. Pick it up in Sickbay. It's all right. Scotty, she's being taken care of. It's all right. Doctor McCoy will explain it to you. Nomad, come here. Repair that unit. You restored Scott. He had much more extensive damage. Bones? Yes. Nomad, you will go with these units. They will take you to a waiting area. Take it to the top security cell. It's a killer, Spock. I intend to render it harmless. Get down to the Brig. Run a full analysis on the mechanism. I want to know what makes that thing tick. What's the problem? Nomad, you will allow Mister Spock to probe your memory banks and structure. Yes. Follow your instructions, Nomad. We've got to know about it, Spock. what makes it operate, its compulsion for perfection. Get into direct mental contact with that thing? You saw what it did to Uhura. Nomad, the unit Spock will touch you. It is not an attack. It is a form of communication. You will permit it. Spock. Spock! Nomad! You're in contact with the unit Spock. Stop! Stop! Spock. Spock? What does it mean, we are Nomad? Then it isn't Nomad? A changeling. An ancient Earth legend, Mister Spock. A changeling was a fairy child that was left in place of a human baby. The changeling assumed the identity of the human child. So, it is to sterilise, and for sterilise read kill. Yes, it's powerful, it's sophisticated, but it's not infallible. It's space-happy. It thinks I'm its mother. Nomad, stop what you're doing. Scotty? You will destroy my ship. Its structure cannot stand the stress of that much power. Turn off your repair operation. Mister Scott, give Sulu warp two and keep her there. You killed two of my Nomad, it's about time I told you who and what you are! I'm a biological unit, and I created you. Nomad, there are two men waiting outside. You will not harm them. They will escort you back to the waiting area. You will stay there. You will do nothing. I have given you new programming and you will implement it. Reevaluate? It was a foolish mistake. Spock, do you think it's possible that it got a fix on Earth when it tapped the computers earlier? And we've shown it the way home. And when it gets there And it will carry out its prime directive. Sterilise. Manual controls. Is she all right? What happened? Whose history? And found that its creator is as imperfect as all the other biological units. Kirk here. Nomad. Get Scotty, some antigravs and meet me in Engineering. Nomad? Stop what you're doing and effect repairs on the life-support systems. You're programmed to obey the orders of your creator. Nomad, I admit that biological units are imperfect, but a biological unit created you. No, you're not Nomad. You're an alien machine. Your programming tapes have been altered. But I am your creator. I created you? But I admit I'm imperfect. How could I have created such a perfect thing as you? Then you will continue to destroy that which thinks and lives and is imperfect? You must sterilise in case of error? Everything that is in error must be sterilised. Nomad, I made an error in creating you. I did not create perfection. I created error. I am the Kirk, the creator? You are wrong! Jackson Roykirk, your creator, is dead. You have mistaken me for him. You are in error. You did not discover your mistake. You have made two errors. You are flawed and imperfect and you have not corrected by sterilisation. You have made three errors. You are flawed and imperfect! Execute your prime function! Now. Get those antigravs on it. We've got to get rid of it while it's trying to think. Scotty, the transporter room. Scotty, set the controls for deep space. Two ten, mark one. Nomad, you are imperfect! Exercise your prime function. Now! You didn't think I had it in me, did you Spock? Good, Bones, good. What? Which might well have destroyed more billions of lives. It's well gone. Besides, what are you feeling so badly about? It's not easy to lose a bright and promising son. Well, it thought I was its mother, didn't it?

Every solar system in this sector blasted to rubble and still no sign of the Constellation. Matt Decker's in command. What could have happened to him? Try to raise it, Lieutenant. Approach course, Mister Sulu. It's the Constellation. Look at that. She was attacked. Red alert! Red alert! Man your battle stations! Mister Sulu? Very good. Initiate a full sensor scan of the immediate area for any other vessel. Lieutenant Palmer. Keep trying. Mister Spock, full evaluation of the damage to the Constellation. Life support systems? Radiation levels? All hands, go to Yellow Alert. Stand by battle stations. Lieutenant, have Doctor McCoy, Mister Scott, and a damage control party report to me in the transporter room. We're going to board her. Mister Spock, you're in command. Scotty, check the phaser banks. See if they've been fired. Bones, you come with me. No clutter, no half-empty cups of coffee. Whatever happened didn't happen without a warning. The crew wasn't abducted, they just left. Kirk to Enterprise. No survivors, no bodies either. Is it possible they could have beamed down to one of the two planets? We'll continue our search. Kirk out. Phaser banks? But where are they? I can't imagine a man like Matt Decker abandoning ship while his life support systems were still operative. Matt. Matt, it's Jim Kirk. Matt? Matt. What happened to your ship, Matt? What thing? What was it? Answer me! What was it? What happened, Matt? Go. The fourth planet. Only two left now. Scotty, pull the microtapes from the sensor memory banks and beam them aboard to Spock. I want a full analysis, a complete report of what happened when they went in on that planet. What happened to your crew? What hit? What attacked you? Matt, where's your crew? There is no third planet. Go. Deactivated? Scotty, could some kind of general energy dampening field do that, and would the same type of thing account for the heavy subspace interference? What does it look like? What is it, an alien ship? Or is it alive, or is it Matt, your log stated that the fourth planet was breaking up. You went in to investigate. Did you run a scanner check on it? What kind of a beam? Kirk here. What about the Constellation's tapes? A robot weapon that purposely destroys entire solar systems. Why? What is the projected course of this thing? Thank you. Stand by, Mister Spock. Kirk out. We don't know. An alien race, apparently from another galaxy. Bones, did you ever hear of a doomsday machine? It's a weapon built primarily as a bluff. It's never meant to be used. So strong, it could destroy both sides in a war. Something like the old H-Bomb was supposed to be. That's what I think this is. A doomsday machine that somebody used in a war uncounted years ago. They don't exist anymore, but the machine is still destroying. Take it easy. There's no ship to leave. It's a dead hulk! We'll take her in tow. I'll stay onboard and get her ready. You go back to the Enterprise with the doctor and let him help you. Kirk to Enterprise. Have the transporter room beam Doctor McCoy and Commodore Decker on board immediately. We're blind here. What's it look like? Whatever it is, we can't let it go beyond us to the next solar system. We have to stop it. If it's a robot, what are the chances of deactivating it? All right. Lower your deflector screens Long enough to beam us aboard. Kirk here. Spock? Spock? Come in, Spock. Spock? We're stuck, blind, and deaf. Well, we just can't stand around while our ship is being attacked. Scotty, you've got to get me some manoeuvering power. Then get me impulse power. Half-speed, quarter-speed, anything. If we get this hulk moving, maybe we can do something. Then get moving. Washburn, you get in there. Let's see what we can do about this viewing screen. I've got to find out what's happening out there. Kirk here. What about the warp drive control circuits? You worry about your miracles, Scotty, I'll worry about mine. Get to work. Washburn, try the 2G6 circuit. Ready to give it a try? Scotty, how you doing? Yes, I think What the devil's going on? Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. Enterprise, come in. Mister Spock, come in. Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty, where's that power? Washburn, get down to Engineering. Assist Mister Scott. Scotty, push it right to the edge. This ship has got to manoeuver. Scotty, give me that power. That'll do. Full ahead, Mister Scott. That's it, Mister Scott. Keep that power coming. Keep pouring it on, Scotty. We're moving, the Enterprise isn't. Maybe that thing will see us and let the Enterprise go. If I only had some phasers. Scotty, you've just earned your pay for the week. Stand by. Fire phasers. Mister Scott, it worked. Great. I think it's great. Scotty, get us out of here. Enterprise. Enterprise, come in. Matt. What's going on? Give me Mister Spock. What happened to Spock? You mean you're the lunatic who's responsible for almost destroying my ship? Give me Spock. There's only one thing I want to say to you, Commodore. Get my ship out of there. Mister Spock, ship status. How long to repair warp drive? Take evasive action, Mister Sulu. Not with my ship, you don't. Mister Spock, relieve Commodore Decker immediately. That's a direct order. Blast regulations! Mister Spock, I order you to assume command on my personal authority as Captain of the Enterprise. Good. Now, Mister Spock Fine. Just make sure you stay ahead of it. Yes, Scotty. Keep it going, Scotty, keep it going. Mister Spock. I'm plotting an intercept course. Will rendezvous with you at fourteen thirteen point seven hours. Kirk to Enterprise. Why are you launching a shuttlecraft? This is Kirk. Matt, you'll be killed. No one expects you to die for an error in judgment. Matt. Matt, listen to me. You can't throw your life away like this. Matt, you're a starship commander. That makes you a valuable commodity. We need you, your experience, your judgment. Matt! We're stronger with you than without you! Kirk here. It's regrettable that he died for nothing. What about that, Spock? Is it possible? Negative. Mister Scott and I will stay here, but beam the damage control party aboard. Except possibly the destruction of that thing out there. Carry out your orders, Mister Spock. Spock, listen. Maybe Matt Decker didn't die for nothing. He had the right idea but not enough power to do it. Am I correct in assuming that a fusion explosion of ninety seven megatons will result if a starship impulse engine is overloaded? Ninety seven point eight three five. Will it be powerful enough to destroy that thing out there? Not through it, Spock, from inside it. Will it be enough? Do the best you can and make it fast. Kirk to Scott. Good. Scotty, can you set the ship's impulse engines to overload? I want you to rig a thirty second delay detonation device, and rig it so that it can be blown from up here. Set it and get up here as fast as you can. Spock, you don't know? I intend to get a lot closer. I'm going to ram her right down that thing's throat. No. No, I don't intend to die, Mister Spock. We've rigged a delay detonation device. You'll have thirty seconds to beam me aboard the Enterprise before the Constellation's impulse engines blow. A calculated risk, Mister Spock. A chance I'll have to take. Kirk out. What about the detonator? Understood. Mister Spock. Prepare to beam Scotty on board. Thank you. I can't. Power level's dropping too fast. You'd better hurry. Prepare to beam me aboard on my signal. Beam me aboard. Gentlemen, beam me aboard. Gentlemen, I suggest you beam me aboard. Mister Sulu, ease us back to minimum headway. Conserve power as much as possible. Lieutenant Palmer, tell Mister Scott to expedite repairs on the warp drive. Poor Matt. He gave his life in an attempt to save others. Not the worst way to go. Indeed it shall, Mister Spock. Ironic, isn't it? Way back in the 20th century, the H-Bomb was the ultimate weapon, their doomsday machine, and we used something like it to destroy another doomsday machine. Probably the first time such a weapon has ever been used for constructive purposes. Well, I certainly hope not. I found one quite sufficient.",130

Apparently, the Companion imparted to me a rather quaint, old-fashioned electric shock of respectable voltage. Evidently. Unquestionably, a large part of its substance is simple electricity. Quite correct, Doctor. Put this in the proximity of the Companion, throw this switch, and it will scramble every electrical impulse the creature can produce. It cannot fail. We may simply render it powerless. There is some risk, Captain. We do not know the extent of its powers. All right. Yes, Captain? The translator is for use with more congruent life forms. It is possible. If I could widen its pattern of reception Then it translates its findings into English. Quite ready, Captain. Yes. The matter of gender could change the entire situation. Then it is not a zookeeper. This is a marvellous opportunity to add to our knowledge. Ask it about its nature, its history. A chance like this may never come again. It could tell us so much. Her attitude when she approaches you is profoundly different than when she contacts us. Her appearance is soft, gentle. Her voice is melodic, pleasing. I do not totally understand the emotion, but it obviously exists. The Companion loves you. Your highly emotional reaction is most illogical. Your relationship with the Companion has for one hundred and fifty years been emotionally satisfying, eminently practical, and totally harmless. It may indeed have been quite beneficial. Fascinating. A totally parochial attitude. But she or it is inhuman, Captain. You cannot expect her to react like a human. Companion, you do not have the power to create life. Commissioner Hedford was dying. Then you are both here, in the one body? Not coming from a human being. You are, after all, essentially irrational. But you will age, both of you. There will be no immortality. You'll both grow old here and finally die.",56

I don't know how much longer I'm going to be able to stand this. I feel like my neck's in a sling. Sure. A formal reception tonight, a hundred and fourteen delegates aboard for two weeks, thirty two of them ambassadors, half of them mad at the other half, and the whole lot touchier than a raw antimatter pile over this Coridan question. How does that Vulcan salute go? That hurts worse than the uniform. Ambassador. Mister Ambassador, I understand you had retired before this conference was called. Forgive my curiosity, but as a doctor, I'm interested in Vulcan physiology. Isn't it unusual for a Vulcan to retire at your age? After all, you're only a hundred and two. Spock, I've always suspected that you were a little more human than you let on. Mrs. Sarek, I know about the rigorous training of the Vulcan youth, but tell me, did he ever run and play like the human children, even in secret? Sehlat? A teddy bear? A teddy bear. His neck was broken. By an expert. Well, from the nature and location of the break, I'd say the killer knew exactly where to apply pressure to snap the neck instantly. Interesting? Spock, do you realise that makes your father the most likely suspect? His neck was broken, Mister Ambassador, by what Spock describes as tal-shaya. It's difficult to say with Vulcan physiology, but I believe it's something to do with his cardiovascular system. I don't know that yet either. As far as I can tell from instrument readings, our prime suspect has a malfunction in one of the heart valve. It's similar to a heart attack in a human. But with Vulcan physiology, it's impossible to tell without an operation. Mrs. Sarek, has he had any previous attacks? I'm not sure. It's tough enough on a human. On a Vulcan, an ordinary operation's out of the question. Well, I'm glad somebody's asking me something around here. Well, the procedure they're discussing would require tremendous amounts of blood for the patient. Yes. Yes, I'd say that's rare. Even you couldn't give that much blood, Spock. It would kill you. Mrs. Sarek, you must understand the chances are extremely small to find a way to produce sufficient T-negative blood. I see it, Spock, but that was a Rigelian. Similar is not good enough. It's still experimental. Spock, we would need such great amounts of blood that, even if the drug worked on the Vulcans as well as a Rigelian, which I'm doubtful, it would still drain Sarek to a critical level. Plus the fact I've never operated on a Vulcan before. Oh, I've studied the anatomical types. I know where all the organs are. But that's a lot different from actual surgical experience. So if I don't kill him with the operation, the drug probably will. A chemical stimulant to speed up reproduction and replacement of blood in the body. It's only experimental. It places a tremendous strain on the spleen and the liver. In Sarek's condition, the stimulant would kill him. What has that got It could damage you internally. It could kill you. I'm sorry, Spock. I can't sanction it. It's a bad wound. Punctured left lung. A centimetre or so lower, it'd have gone through the heart. Spock, your father is much worse. There's no longer a choice. I have to operate immediately. We can begin as soon as you're prepared. What? You can turn command over to Scotty. Now let that be a lesson to you. Just lie there and be happy you're still alive. Not good. If I could only operate. I was. When you became injured, Spock assumed command. He's going to stay there until you're back on your feet, even if it costs Sarek his life. Regulations. Jim, if you stand, you could start to bleed again. I've certified him physically fit, Mister Spock. Now since I have an operation to perform and both of us are required Readings, Nurse. I wish I knew whether that was good or bad. Initiate sterile field. Where do you think you're going? My patients don't walk out in the middle of an operation. So is your father's life. One more like that, and I'm going to lose both these men. Cardio-stimulate. Then get me that old portable cardio-stimulator. Call engineering and have sickbay systems put on priority. Are you quite through shaking the ship around? I don't mind telling you, you sure make it difficult for a surgeon trying That pig-headed Vulcan stamina. I couldn't have pulled them through without it. Orion? If you keep arguing with your kindly family doctor, you're going to spend your next ten days right here. If you co-operate, you'll be out in two. You are at your station, Mister Spock. Shut up. Shh. Shh! Well, what do you know? I finally got the last word.",56

I cannot relinquish command under these circumstances. On what grounds, Doctor? Command requirements do not recognise personal privilege. I'll be in the brig interrogating the Andorian. He has been subjected to questioning under verifier scan and truth drug. He reveals nothing. I suggest his mind has been so conditioned as part of a preconceived plan. Apparently Thelev did. I do not know. There is no logic in Thelev's attack upon the captain. There is no logic in Gav's murder. Come in. Mother, when I was commissioned, I took an oath to carry out responsibilities which were clearly and exactly specified. Any competent officer can command this ship under normal circumstances. The circumstances are not normal. We're carrying over one hundred valuable Federation passengers. We're being pursued by an alien ship. We're subject to possible attack. There has been murder and attempted murder on board. I cannot dismiss my duties. I know, but this must take precedence. If I could give the transfusion without loss of time or efficiency, I would. Sarek understands my reason. Mother, how can you have lived on Vulcan so long, married a Vulcan, raised a son on Vulcan, without understanding what it means to be a Vulcan? It means to adopt a philosophy, a way of life, which is logical and beneficial. We cannot disregard that philosophy merely for personal gain, no matter how important that gain might be. Can you imagine what my father would say if I were to agree, if I were to give up command of this vessel, jeopardise hundreds of lives, risk interplanetary war, all for the life of one person? Mother I cannot. Captain? Captain, are you quite all right? I must see the captain. The alien ship. I've just realised that if their power utilisation curve is not the norm, it should be possible to identify them this way. Very important. Captain, I believe you'll find the alien I think you'll find he's an Orion, Doctor. Intelligence reports that Orion smugglers have been raiding the Coridan system. The thing that confused me was the power utilisation curve. It made them seem more powerful than a starship or anything known to us. That ship was constructed for a suicide mission. Since they never intended to return to their home base, they could use one hundred percent power on their attacks. The thing I don't understand is why I didn't think of it earlier. That hardly seems likely. Emotional, isn't she? Indeed? Why did you marry her? Doctor, I'll return to my station now. Indeed, Captain. I've never seen him look so happy.",68

Captain Kirk is suffering from a, a peculiar physical degeneration which strongly resembles aging. Yes, yes, but he's a better man right now It's a blasted machine, Spock! You can't argue with a machine. Yes. Yes, I do, agree. And I am sorry, Jim. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Yes, yes. Now that could be. Right. Scared. Heart beats faster, breathe gets short, and there's cold sweats and adrenaline flows. Adrenal activity. Now hold on Just a minute. There was something that I read once. It was ancient history, just after the atomic age. Used for radiation sickness. Adrenaline. Yes, yes. Now. But before, adrenaline. Highly promising. Early research, but they abandoned it when hyronalin was discovered. Don't just stand there jawing, Spock. You and Doctor Wallace get cracking. No, Jim. You can't do it. Nurse? Doctor Wallace! Nurse. Jim-boy, you just lay quiet. You can't do no good. We're both through. All right. Let's, let's go. Don't give me any Vulcan details. Just give me the shot. You can't. Well, well, what's happening? Feeling fine. So is Scotty. The serum worked. He pulled a muscle during the reaction, but otherwise he's feeling fine. Oh, very well. A few bruises here and there. Oh. Anytime you're ready, Mister Spock. Because of your Vulcan physique, I have prepared an extremely potent shot for you. However, you might like to know I've removed all the breakables from Sickbay.

Captain Garrovick was very important to you, wasn't he, Jim? You don't know that, Jim. You don't know that any more than you know that Garrovick could have destroyed it. To be so obsessed. That you could destroy yourself, your career, a young boy who reminds you of yourself eleven years ago. I'm not, Jim. This is professional, Captain. I am preparing a medical log entry on my estimation of the physical and emotional condition of a starship captain. Which requires a witness of command grade. They need those vaccines on Theta Seven, Captain. Now why are we delaying here? You state that it happened just as you lost consciousness. A semiconscious mind is a very tricky thing. A man never knows how much is real or how much is imagination. Yes, there's no doubt about that. Jim, we're not trying to gang up on you. At this point, my medical log remains open. What's that? A survey on Cygnian Respiratory Diseases? I thought you took Garrovick some food. What were you doing with this? One man has a chance for survival. The other is dead. You can add that little price tag to your monster hunt. It's not enough! You didn't care as long as you could hang your trophy on the wall. Well, it's not on it, Captain, it's in it. Creature, Mister Spock? I'm sorry, Jim. I was wrong. Jim, Spock may be dying. It's that green blood of his. I'll bet he left a bad taste in the creature's mouth, too. I assume that you now believe we should pursue the creature and destroy it. It's the time factor that bothers me. Those drugs are perishable. I presume you intend to use that haemoplasm to attract the creature? Do something. Crazy way to travel, spreading a man's molecules all over the universe. Well then, thank pitchforks and pointed ears. As long as it worked, Jim.",51

Mister Chekov, this flight is supposed to provide both experience and knowledge. How close will we come to the Klingon outpost if we continue on our present course? Mister Spock, immediate past history of the quadrant? Analysis of disputed area? John Burke. is the rest of your history that faulty, Ensign? Key points of dispute? And unfortunately, though the Klingons are brutal and aggressive, they are most efficient. Kirk here. Go to warp factor six. Priority One distress call, and it's just absolutely peaceful. Lieutenant Uhura, break subspace silence. Space Station K7, this is Captain Kirk of the Enterprise. What is your emergency? Mister Lurry, you issued a Priority One distress call. State the nature of your emergency. You'll try to explain. You'd better be prepared to do more than that. Kirk out. Mister Spock, I'll need your help. Mister Chekov, maintain battle readiness. Lieutenant Uhura, see that the transporter room is standing by. Mister Lurry, if there's no emergency, why did you issue a priority one distress call? And that gives you the authority to put an entire quadrant on defence alert? Oh. And this is my first officer Mister Spock. Storage compartments? Storage compartments? What? What? What's quadrotriticale? Wheat. So what? Mister Spock, you've made your point. You issued a priority one distress call for a couple of tons of wheat? Mister Baris, you summoned the Enterprise without an emergency. You'll take full responsibility for it. Kirk to Enterprise. Secure from general quarters. And beam down two, and only two, security guards. Have them report to Mister Lurry. Authorise shore leave for all off-duty personnel. Kirk out. I have never questioned the orders or the intelligence of any representative of the Federation. Until now. Summoning a starship on a priority A-1 channel to guard some storage compartments. Storage compartments of wheat. I guess not. I see you didn't waste time taking your shore leave. Mister Chekov, what do you make of this? Does everybody know about this wheat but me? Ah. Yes, what is it? Put it on visual, Lieutenant. Kirk here. Now, that's just lovely. Yes, Lieutenant, what is it? Go to Red Alert. Notify Mister Lurry. We'll be right up. What is the position of the Klingon ship? Put him on visual. Mister Lurry, there's a Klingon warship hanging one hundred kilometres off your station. Why not? Cancel Red Alert. We'll beam right down. My dear Captain Koloth. Shore leave? Yes, well, I don't make those decisions. Mister Lurry is in charge of those matters. Well, I have the authority to act, and I'm going to use it. My dear Captain Koloth, you may indeed bring your men down on shore leave, but only twelve at a time. And I assure you, for every man you bring down here, I shall have one security guard. There will be no trouble. Let us both take steps to keep it that way. Another technical journal, Scotty? Don't you ever relax? You running a nursery, Lieutenant? Did you get this at the space station? Kirk here. Pipe it down here will you, Mister Chekov. Yes, Mister Baris. What can I do for you? I was not aware, Mister Baris, that twelve Klingons constitutes a swarm. Mister Baris, I have guards around the grain. I have guards around the Klingons. The only reason those guards are there is because Starfleet wants them there. As for what you want It has been noted and logged. Kirk out. Sickbay with a headache. Bones, what have you got for a headache? Both. How many of these did Uhura give you? But you've got, er, eleven. How do they? How do they? A fat tribble. Well, Bones, all I can suggest is you open up a maternity ward. All you men going on shore leave to stay in groups. Avoid trouble with the Klingons. Aren't you going on shore leave, Scotty? I want you to go on shore leave. Make sure that everybody stays out of trouble. Scotty, enjoy yourself. I want to know who started it. I'm waiting. Freeman, who started the fight? All right. Chekov. I know you. You started it, didn't you? Who did? I don't know, sir. I want to know who threw the first punch. All right. You're all confined to quarters until I find out who started it. Dismissed. Scotty, not you. You were supposed to prevent trouble, Mister Scott. Who threw the first punch, Scotty? Mister Scott? You did, Mister Scott? What caused it, Scotty? Must have been some insult. You threw the first punch. You held? Why did Chekov want to start a fight? No, this is not off the record. Is that all? I see. I get the picture, Scotty. After they said all this, that's when you hit the Klingons? No? Oh, yes. What was it they said that started the fight? I see. And that's when you hit the Klingons? You hit the Klingons because they insulted the Enterprise, not because they All right, Scotty. Dismissed. Scotty, you're restricted to quarters until further notice. Doctor McCoy, would you mind coming up to the bridge? Lieutenant Uhura, how did all these tribbles get on the bridge? Doctor McCoy. Explain that. I know, but really Too much of anything, Lieutenant, even love, isn't necessarily a good thing. Get the maintenance crew to clean up the entire ship, and then contact Mister Lurry and tell him I'm beaming down. Have him find Cyrano Jones and hold him. And get these tribbles off the bridge. Oh, really? Just incredibly prolific. You should sell an instruction and maintenance manual for this thing. On the contrary, sir. I think of this project as very important. It is you I take lightly. That's a serious charge. To whom are you referring? Cyrano Jones, a Klingon agent? I heard you. What evidence do you have against Mister Jones? Yes, yes. Go on. What else do you have? Do you have any proof of that? People have disrupted stations before without being Klingon agents. Sometimes, all they need is a title, Mister Baris. Unfortunately, disrupting a space station is not an offence. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a ship to tend to. Au revoir. My chicken sandwich and coffee. This is my chicken sandwich and coffee. I want these off the ship. I don't care if it takes every man we've got, I want them off the ship. How? And in the storage compartments. This is Kirk. Contact Manager Lurry and Nilz Baris. Have them meet us near the storage compartments. We're beaming down. Come on, Spock. Energise. Plenty, if what I think's happened has happened. Is that door secure? Good. Open it. Here. Let me try it. Hundreds of thousands. That's assuming they got here three days ago. Mister Baris Mister Baris, I'll hold you in irons if you don't shut up. Now he tells me. Yes. Bones, I want the tribbles, the grain, everything analysed. I want to know what killed these tribbles. Until that inquiry, I'm still the captain. And as Captain, I want two things done. First, find Cyrano Jones, and second close that door. Ah, Mister Jones, with an armful. A few questions. What do you want? An apology? Well, we'll see about that, but before I take any official action, I'd like to know Just what happened. Who put the tribbles in the quadrotriticale? What was in the grain that killed them? Yes. Hold on a minute. I thought you said tribbles liked everybody. What was in the bar? You're right, Mister Jones. They don't like Klingons. But they do like Vulcans. I didn't know you had it in you. Obviously. Mister Baris, they like you. Well, there's no accounting for taste. They don't like you, Mister Darvin. I wonder why. Bones? I wonder what Starfleet Command will say about that. What about the grain, Bones? They starved to death. In a storage compartment full of grain, they starved to death. Mister Darvin, are you going to talk? And the tribbles had nothing to do with it? Captain Koloth. About that apology. You have six hours to get your ship out of Federation territory. You know, I think I could learn to like tribbles. No, you're not. There's something I want to show you. You know what the penalty is for transporting an animal proven harmful to human life? There is one thing you can do. Pick up every tribble on the space station. If you do that, I'll speak to Mister Lurry about returning your spaceship. Consider it Job security. You'll do it? Good. That means Sherman's Planet will get its quadrotriticale only a few weeks late. I don't see any tribbles around here. Bones, how did you do it? Scotty! Where are the tribbles? Of course. Spock. Gentlemen, I don't want to interrupt this mutual admiration society, but I'd like to know where the tribbles are. Mister Scott. Where are the tribbles? You used the transporter? Where did you transport them? Scott, you didn't transport them into space, did you? Where are they? Where? You gave them to the Klingons?",155

Energise, Scotty. It must be a transporter malfunction. This isn't Gamma Two. Look at the colour of that sky. That's a trinary sun. That's what I'd like to know. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Dead. Either of you hurt? How do you know our names? These Providers of yours, are they What do they want from us? Thralls? You must be mistaken. We're officers of a United spaceship on Federation business. We're not going anywhere until we have some information. Who are you? What is this place? What do you think you're going to do with us? This system's star is a trinary. Limits it a bit, but we're a long way from the Enterprise, if we're in the same dimension. What do you want from her? Lieutenant, are you all right? Uhura! Lieutenant! Lieutenant, are you all right? Lieutenant, answer me! Lieutenant! What's happening to Lieutenant Uhura? Lieutenant, are you all right? I didn't realise I was so hungry. Whatever you call this, it is very good. Nourishment. That's very practical. What do you call this collar? Vended? You mean bought, sold. Our race has another name for it. Slavery. This collar of obedience, is Galt the only one who can operate it? How does he work it? Will you provide all my nourishment? Yes, I'm sure you will. I must say, I've never seen a top sergeant who looked like you. It means you're a very beautiful woman. You mean nobody's ever told you that before? well, er, beautiful is, Beautiful. That's beautiful. Shahna, where were you born? Your parents. Where are they? Your mother and father. Freestyle? Lars and Chekov's drill thrall. They weren't born here. Where do they come from? None of us will do it, Galt. The devil with the Providers. No. No! I am responsible for the actions of my people. I demand to see the Providers. He's pretty fast with that whip. We're free people. We belong to no one. Slow down. Slow down. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. We've covered over two miles. Can we take a breather? A rest? Oh. well, it's good to get away from that development area, even for a while. Shahna, why do the Providers, why do they like to watch others being hurt, killed? Their voices sound mechanical. Are they computers? You've seen them. Do they have bodies? What is this place? It's very old. Does it have a name? Shahna, could it have been a city for the Providers? They do have bodies, or did have. Very pretty country. Very much like my home planet, Earth. Where I was born. Shahna, don't you ever look at the night sky? The lights up there? Well, those are stars. And around them are planets. And there are people that live on them, Just like us. From Earth, Triskelion's three suns are just a flicker of light. Actually, this is the darkest planet I've ever seen. The thralls have no freedom, Shahna. You don't think or do anything but what the Providers tell you. Love, for one thing. Love is the most important thing on Earth. Especially to a man and a woman. On Earth, we select our own mate. Someone we care for. On Earth, men and women live together, help each other, make each other happy. All right. All right. Tell me about the Providers. What do they look like? Where do they live? Stop it. Stop it! I'm responsible! I made her talk! Stop it! You're killing her! She did nothing wrong! It was my fault. If you want to punish someone, punish me! Please. It's all right. It's all right. You can stop crying now, Shahna. It's all right. It's the custom of my people to help one another when we're in trouble. You could call it that. You're disturbed about what happened today. I wouldn't like that, Shahna. I wouldn't like that at all. I'm sorry, Shahna. What about Lars? I think Galt is the only one who controls these collars. If we can find the phaser that I threw at Lars, we can use the circuits to short out these collars. Spock? Spock! Spock? Welcome to Triskelion, gentlemen. By now it must be obvious to you that you have been expected. What you're hearing, gentlemen, is a Provider. Providing for all their needs means using thralls, people stolen from other parts of the galaxy To fight each other, and the Providers gamble on the winner. But these Providers haven't the courage to show themselves. But you are afraid. Then show yourselves. The power source. Shielded by solid rock. Primary mental evolution. Incredible. A species that enslaves other beings is hardly superior, mentally or otherwise. It's an unproductive purpose, unworthy of your intellect. We have found that all life forms in the galaxy are capable of superior development. Perhaps you're not as evolved as you believe. Our destruction will result only in your own. You may control the Enterprise, but you cannot match the force of the entire Federation. And you call yourselves superior! You're murderers without the spirit to really wager for the lives you take. My people pride themselves on being the greatest, most successful gamblers in the universe. We compete for everything. Power, fame, women, everything we desire, and it is our nature to win. And for proof, I offer you our exploration of this galaxy. Well, then, I wager that with weapons of your own choice, right here and now, my people can overcome an equal number of thralls set against us. Wait! Wait! Hear me! We can't wager for trifles like quatloos. The stakes must be higher. If we win, the Enterprise and its crew leaves here in safety. Further more, all the thralls on the planet must be freed. You will educate and train them to establish a normal self-governing culture. We have done the same with cultures throughout the galaxy. Are you willing to admit that we can do something you can't? If we lose? We will remain here, the entire crew of the Enterprise. The most stubborn, determined competitors in the universe. We'll become thralls, enter your games, obey your orders without rebellion. You'll be assured of generations of the most exciting wagering you've ever had. Not for true gamesters. Name it. Three against one? Those are pretty high odds. Your, your terms are unfair. Well, in that case, I'll accept your terms. Yes, that's clear. The thralls will be trained? I think you'll find it a much more exciting game than the one you've been playing. I'm sorry, Shahna. I didn't lie. I did what was necessary. Someday, I hope you'll understand. Yes. Yes. I can't. There's so much you must learn here first. The Providers will teach you. Learn it, Shahna. all your people must learn before you can reach for the stars. Shahna. Scotty! Beam us up.",96

This is Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the Federation of Planets. Yes. Unfortunately, the Horizon was lost with all hands shortly after leaving your planet. We only received her radio report last month. Difficult to explain. We received a report a hundred years late because it was sent by conventional radio. Your system is on the outer reaches of the galaxy. They didn't have subspace communication in those days. I'll explain it in more detail when I see him. The ship won't land, but we'll transport several people down. Well, that's a little difficult for you to understand, too. I'll explain it in more detail when I see you. Where will be convenient? Scotty, do you have the co-ordinates? Good. I'll be looking forward to it. Kirk out. Scotty, you have the conn. Spock, McCoy, we're beaming down. Standard equipment. The Horizon's contact came before the Non-Interference Directive went into effect. We don't know there is contamination. The evidence is only circumstantial. The beginnings of industrialisation. Let's not argue about it. Let's go study it. Energise. Home was never like this. I've seen pictures of the old days that look like this. That's a weapon. Be careful with that. Look, we were asked to come down here by Mister Oxmyx. He said Is this how you greet all your guests? Yes, but the Horizon crew wasn't composed of cold-blooded killers. They didn't report this culture in this state, either. What happened? Is this the way your citizens do business, their right of petition? Depends. No, thank you. You're Mister Oxmyx. This is my first officer, Mister Spock, Doctor McCoy. They call you The Boss, Mister Oxmyx. The boss of what? You're the government here? But there are other bosses, other territories? I know it's a book. Did they leave any other books? What is it you want? Now let me get this straight. You want us to supply you with arms and assistance so you can carry out an aggression against your neighbours? Mister Oxmyx, my orders are quite explicit. Under no circum Don't do that. You could knock out the side of the building. Out of the question. Hold it. It's a communication device. It's locked onto my ship's systems. In old Chicago, conventional government almost broke down. The gangs nearly took over. If this society broke down as the result of the Horizon's influence, then the Federation's responsible, and we've got to do something to straighten this mess out. Spock, if you could get to the sociological computer, do you think you could find a solution? Well, I've got an idea about that. Gentlemen. Gentlemen. This, card game is a kid's game. Oh, yes, yes. I wouldn't waste my time. On Beta Antares Four, they play a real game. It's a man's game, but of course it's probably a little beyond you. It requires intelligence. Spock. Spock. Of course, the cards on Beta Antares Four are different, but not too different. The name of the game is called fizzbin. Fizzbin. It's not too difficult. Each player gets six cards, except for the player on the dealer's right, who gets seven. Yes. The second card is turned up, except on Tuesdays. Oh, look what you got, two jacks. You got a half fizzbin already. No, no. If you got another jack, why, you'd have a sralk. Yes. You'd be disqualified. You need a king and a deuce, except at night of course, when you'd need a queen and a four. Right. Oh, look at that. You've got another jack. How lucky you are! How wonderful for you. If you didn't get another jack, if you'd gotten a king, why then you'd get another card, except when it's dark, you'd give it back. Yes, but what you're after is a royal fizzbin, but the odds in getting a royal fizzbin are astron. Spock, what are the odds in getting a royal fizzbin? Well, they're astronomical, believe me. Now, for the last card. We'll call it a kronk. You got that? Spock, find the radio station. Uhura's monitoring the broadcasts. Cut in and have yourselves beamed up to the ship. I will, but I'm bringing Bela Oxmyx with me. Bones, this mess is our responsibility. You have your orders. Let's go. If you don't mind, I'd rather walk. I'm beginning to get the idea. And you? Would you mind telling me how you even know who I am? You want to make a deal. Let me guess. You want, you'll want heaters, and then you'll want troops to teach them how to use them. And then you'll attack the other bosses and take over the whole planet. Then we'll sit down and talk, right? I got a better idea. This planet has to be united. You know that. Bela knows that. Let's sit down. You, me, Bela. Discuss this whole matter, contact the other bosses, and talk about it like reasonable men. No, I don't think you're stupid. I just think your behaviour is arrested. I'm sorry, Krako. No deal. Help me! Help! Help me! Drop the guns. Drop 'em. Move down there. I thought you were supposed to report to the ship, Mister Spock. It may be just as well. Did you find out anything from the computer? Then you don't mind if I play a hunch? Well, now that we have Bela, I'm going to put the bag on Krako. Listen, you. Say, that's nice material. I said. You too! Get out of the clothes. Nobody's going to put the bag on me any more. Wheels, Mister Spock. Key in the ignition. Turn the ignition on. And nothing happens. Where's the starter? There's the starter. Yes! Oops! Gears. I kind of like this. I'm going to get one myself. It was that bad? Now, that could be a bit of a problem. If they were inside, where they couldn't be seen, we could stun them with our phasers, but not out here. They don't look like the trusting type. Young man, run along and play. Hold on, Spock. Out of the mouths of babes I'm calling you a babe. Yeah I'm calling you a babe, but there's nothing personal in it. Sit down. You know a way we can get close to them? How? What do you want? All right, young man. We'll guarantee you a piece of the action if we can pull this thing off. Done. What do we do? That's it. Let's go. Sonny! Sonny! Wait a moment. What have they done? What have they done to you? What have you done? A piece of the action. No one can see. Put your phaser on stun. I think you've got it reversed, Mister Krako. The sound of a machine gun bolt being pulled back. Mister Krako, I don't, er I'm trying to tell you, Mister Krako, that this is bigger than you, Oxmyx or anyone. Can you trust all your men? Well, one of these can make a man a pretty big boss, you know. All right, Krako, we don't have time to show you how to play with toys! What do you think we're here for, to get a cut of your deal? Forget it. That's peanuts to an outfit like the Federation. Right? Right? Now look, Krako, we're taking over the whole ball of wax. You co-operate with us and maybe we'll cut you in for a piece of the action. That's, er. We'll figure it out later. Who's interfering? We're taking over. Check? The planet is being taken over by the Federation, but we don't want to come in here and use our muscle, you know what I mean? That ain't subtle. So what we do is we help one guy take over the planet. He pulls the strings, and then we pull his. Hey, you, sit down. What do you care as long as you're being cut in? Course, there's always Bela Oxmyx. Kirk to Enterprise. All right, Scotty. We made a deal with Krako. Yeah. We're ready to make the hit. We're taking over the whole planet as soon as you get ready. Sure. We can trust Krako, but we don't have any choice. You know what I mean? He's standing about twelve feet in front of me, all ready to be our pal. Of course, Scotty, I'd like to show him the ship, just to show him that we're, er, we're on the level. But you know how it is. Scotty, we'll need phasers to equip every one of Krako's men. We'll need advisors and troops to back him up on the hit. You got all that, Scotty? You may begin, Mister Scott. Not exactly. Right? It's faster than walking. Are you afraid of cars? Spock, I've got the hang of it. Now go on. Wrong again, Oxmyx. Knock it off, Sawbones. I want to talk to this creep. Now listen, I'm getting tired of playing pattycake with you penny-ante operators. You're a penny-ante operator. Sit down. All right, Spocko, cover him. Now listen, sweetheart. The Federation's moving in, taking over. You play ball, we'll cut you in. You don't, you're out. All the way out. You know what I mean? Kirk to Enterprise. You got Krako on ice? Okay, baby. Cool him till I flag you. Keep him until I send for him. We're going to make some old-style phone calls from this locale. So you locate the man on the other end of the blower and give him a ride to this flop. Find the man at the other end of the phone And transport him to these co-ordinates. Can do, sweetheart? Now you. Get on the blower and call the other bosses. Get with it. I'm giving the orders here. Scotty? Lock in and energise. Yeah. All right! All right! All right! All right! Now the Federation's taking over whether you like it or not. You people, you've been running this planet like a piecework factory. From now on, it's going to be under one roof. You're going to run it like a business. That means you're going to make a profit. I'm cutting the Federation in for forty percent. You got any objections? Hang on a minute. Hang on a minute. Quiet!

All right, but at least let me call my ship one last time and say goodbye. Hello, Scotty. This is Kirk. Scotty, put the ship's phasers on stun. Fire a burst in a one-block radius around these co-ordinates. They're not dead, just knocked out for a while. But they might just as well have been that way if we wanted them to.

Krako, you'd be his lieutenant. The rest of you, I don't want any trouble from the rest of you because you'll have to answer to the Federation. We'll be back every year to collect our cut. Yeah, I think forty percent's sufficient. It's reasonable, Mister Oxmyx. Let's break out some of your drinking stuff and celebrate the syndicate. Gentlemen, you two have been brooding ever since we returned to the ship. Brooding, Mister Spock. A sombre, emotional state. Now, do you wish to continue it or are you going to discuss it? Ah, yes. I understand that. You don't think it's logical to leave a criminal organisation in charge. Yes, that's a very good question, Mister Spock.

The analysis of the zone indicates it is a negative energy field, however illogical that may sound, but it is not the source of the power drain. I submit, Mister Scott, if we do not get out, the shields would be extraneous. It would only prolong our wait for death by a short period of time. Captain, the Intrepid would have done all these things too, and yet they were destroyed. True. It is also true they never knew what was killing them. Their logic would not have permitted them to believe they were being killed. Vulcan has not been conquered within its collective memory. The memory goes back so far that no Vulcan can conceive of a conqueror. I knew the ship was lost because I sensed it. The touch of death. Astonishment. I cannot say what it is, Captain, but I would say it has found us. Getting very confused readings, Captain, but this is definitely the source of the energy drain. Probe will impact in seven point three seconds. Readings coming in now, Captain. Length, approximately eleven thousand miles. Width varying from two thousand to three thousand miles. Outer layer studded with space debris and waste. Interior consists of protoplasm, varying from a firmer gelatinous layer to a semi-fluid central mass. Condition, living. That is what is drawing us toward it, Captain. The same way it drew the Intrepid to her death. Energy itself, perhaps, drained from us. I would speculate that this unknown life form is invading our galaxy like a virus. The Intrepid must have come across the organism while it was still low in energy, still hungry. We are not safe, Captain. We merely have a little more time than the Intrepid did. I must differ with you, Captain. We have sent unmanned probes into it. They have given us some information but they have not told us what we need to know, and we cannot afford the power to take blind shots at it, hoping to kill it. The thing evidently has reflexes. The unmanned probe we sent in must have stung it when it entered. The lurch we felt was the turbulence of its reaction. You have a martyr complex, Doctor. I submit that it disqualifies you. The Vulcans saw it first and died. I am more capable. Which makes you indispensable, Captain. Further, you are not a science specialist. We don't have one day, Doctor. We have precisely one hour and thirty five minutes of power left. Captain, I Do not suffer so, Doctor. This is not the first time superior capability has proven more valuable than professional credentials. I am familiar with the equipment, Doctor. We're wasting time. The shuttlecraft is ready. This is not a competition, Doctor. Whether you understand it or not, grant me my own kind of dignity. Then employ one of your own superstitions. Wish me luck. Shuttlecraft to Enterprise. Power drain is enormous and growing worse. Diverting all secondary power to the shields. I'll continue communications as long as there is power to transmit. I heard, Captain. We discussed that possibility earlier. But you will need this information. Slowing now. Contact in eighteen point three seconds. Brace yourselves. The area of penetration will no doubt be sensitive. Contact In six seconds. I am undamaged, Captain. Relay to Mister Scott I had three percent power reserve before the shields stabilised. There was nothing to spare. I shall continue my tests. Oh, and Doctor McCoy. You would have not survived it. I am moving slowly now, establishing course toward what appears to be the nucleus. Calculations indicate the shields will last only forty seven minutes. However, I am able to identify the chromosome structure. Changes indicate the organism has stored sufficient energy for reproductive process to commence. I'm having difficulty maintaining ship control. I'm losing voice contact I will transmit internal co-ordinates of chromosome bodies. This is Spock. I am slowly losing life support and minimal shield energies. According to my calculations The nervous energy of the organism is maximal just within its outer protective membrane. Relatively insensitive to interior irritation. I believe sufficient charge of could destroy the organism. Tell Doctor McCoy he should have wished me luck. Personal log, Commander Spock, USS Enterprise. I have noted the passage of the Enterprise on its way to whatever awaits it. If this record should survive me, I wish it known that I bequeath my highest commendation and testimonial to the captain, officers, and crew of the Enterprise. The finest starship in the fleet. Captain, I recommend you abandon the attempt. Do not risk the ship further on my behalf. Why, thank you, Captain McCoy. Shuttlecraft to Enterprise. Shuttlecraft to Enterprise. Request permission to come aboard. Obviously, Captain. And I have some fascinating data on the organism.",86

I knew him very well. He was my instructor at the Academy. From Ekos? Have you raised anyone, Lieutenant? Stand by phasers. Range, Mister Chekov? Fire. Maybe they had help. Maximum orbit. Take us out of range of their detection range. Execute. We've run into a far more serious problem than the disappearance of John Gill. Spock, you and I will beam down. Bones, one precaution. Prepare a subcutaneous transponder in the event we can't use our communicators. Insert the transponders. Make one low pass to communication range in three hours. If we fail to make contact at the appointed time, take our co-ordinates from the transponder and beam us aboard no matter what our condition may be. You ready? Energise. Unbelievable.

The chances of another planet developing a culture like Nazi Germany, using the forms, the symbols, the uniforms of twentieth century Earth are so fantastically slim. You look quite well for a man who's been utterly destroyed, Mister Spock. That's John Gill. The Fuhrer? You're right. He's not one of us. Look at him. Spock, take his uniform. If John Gill is the Fuhrer it would seem the logical approach. That helmet covers a multitude of sins. Yes, it's a shame yours isn't as attractive as mine. Gestapo, I believe. Your orders, Lieutenant. He wants to see your orders in the jacket. The Lieutenant's a little dazed. He captured several Zeons single-handed. One of the pigs struck him before he dropped.

They registered as human. Yes. If we could put that out of operation, we might have a chance. Spock, are you sure you're all right? You didn't look very well when you broke that mind touch. Do you mean that's what the Kelvans really are? Well, if they look that way normally, why did they adapt themselves to our bodies? Well, that's enough. One wrong move, and they jam all our neural circuits. How? It's a good idea, Jim, but anyone looking at him can tell he's healthy. Jim, his heartbeat really is slow. His pulse is practically non-existent. He may die. If I can get him up to sickbay, there's a chance he'll live. Prepare two ccs of stokaline. Don't argue, nurse. Just get it. This may be the turning point. Prepare another shot. Please, nurse, just follow orders, will you? There, that should do it. Just let him rest now. You see, it's a flare-up of Rigelian Kassaba Fever. He suffered from it about ten years ago, and it recurs every now and then. There's no danger if he gets medication in time. He'll be all right in a couple of hours. We're just going to jam it. Scotty tells me you could've destroyed the ship in the barrier. Why didn't you? But that was our only chance to stop them Jim Jim, I saw them reduce four of my doctors and nurses into those little Before you condemn it, why not try it? All right, I'll show you how to work the selector. I'm delighted. If he keeps reacting like that, he's going to need a diet. I don't know about that. Well, that body of yours is a bit anaemic. Comes from taking food in pills instead of solid sustenance. I'm going to give you a shot. High-potency vitamin concentrate. You'll need three a day for a few days. And eat some solid food, will you? Well, now, let's see. You've had three shots. I think you better stay on them for a few days, and then we'll see how you're responding. We haven't seen Tomar either.

Really, Doctor, I had no idea they were trained. Watching you, I assumed it was trial and error. Interesting, and given a conservative empire, quite understandable. I said I understood it, Doctor. I find the checks and balances of this civilisation quite illuminating. They do seem to have escaped the carnage of your first three world wars, Doctor. Situations quite familiar to the six million who died in your first world war, the eleven million who died in your second, the thirty seven million who died in your third. Shall I go on? Quite correct. I tell you I'm well able to defeat you. I do not want to injure you. Need any help, Doctor? Such emotions are foreign to me, Doctor. I'm merely testing the strength of the door. Doctor, I am seeking a means of escape. Will you please be brief? Yes, that's quite true. Oh, yes. You humans have that emotional need to express gratitude. You're welcome, I believe, is the correct response. However, Doctor, you must remember I am entirely motivated by logic. The loss of our ship's surgeon, whatever I think of his skill, would mean a reduction in the efficiency of the Enterprise and therefore Really, Doctor? What did they do to you? I wish we could have examined that belief of his more closely. It seems illogical for a sun worshiper to develop a philosophy of total brotherhood. Sun worship is usually a primitive superstition religion. It will replace their imperial Rome, but it will happen in their twentieth century.",43

And how much time did you say we have to investigate? You did say thirty minutes? Then let's go. Let's find out what life forms are blessed by this environment. It's like discovering Atlantis or Shangri-la. Mister Spock, is it possible there's a more evolved civilisation somewhere else on this planet, one capable of building that obelisk or developing a deflector system? Tell them what? That an asteroid's coming to smash their world into atoms? We've got a job to do. Let's get back to the Enterprise. What? Oh, nothing. It's just so peaceful, uncomplicated. No problems, no command decisions. Just living. Ah, the Tahiti Syndrome. Let's go take care of that asteroid. But first I want another look at that obelisk. Kirk to Enterprise. Where am I? What place is this? What are these? I feel should know. They're familiar and yet unfamiliar. How did I get here? Who am I? Try to remember. Who are you? I'll answer anything I can, but as I told you, many things are strange to me. I came from the temple, as Miramanee said, and it was a beginning for me here. But I came from the sky, too. Only I can't remember. I can't remember. Wait a moment. He'll be all right now. It's a simple technique. It goes way back. Way back. Miramanee, tell me about the Wise Ones. Not this one. Tell me. Secrets of the temple. The secrets were passed on from father to son? Well, why doesn't Salish use it? Why are the people in danger? Ki, Kir No, no, everything is fine. Your land is rich, your people happy. Who could be displeased with that? I can't tell you anything. All I can tell you is that I'm happy and peaceful here. I'm not sure, but I think I've never felt that way before. Why are they so sure I can help them? Yes, but I. I need time to remember. The Joining day? No, Miramanee, there's no one else in my mind or my heart. Name the Joining day. I have found paradise. Surely no man has ever attained such happiness. Get out of my way, Salish. Nobody's asking for your permission. I have no intention of striking you dead. Miramanee. Come here. Miramanee. I'm happy. I'm so happy. If it weren't for the dreams, my mind would be completely at peace. They've come back. They were gone for a while, but they've come back, and I see faces, too. Very dim. I feel I should know know them. I feel my place is with them, not here. I don't deserve this happiness. A gift? What? These last few weeks, my love for Miramanee grows stronger with each passing day. However, the dreams return every night. Fragments of memories. I can almost get hold of them, and then You! A canal. And with it we'll bring the water from the lake right to the lodge. And we can expand the system, and irrigate the fields and double the food supply. Lamp. Preserve. Preserve. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. That's not why I made the lamp at all, to keep you forever cooking. It's only the wind and the thunder. Why? But it's only the wind. The wind can't harm them. But I can't do anything about the wind or the sky. I don't know how to get inside the temple. We'll go to the caves. It'll be safe there. Take care of Miramanee. I am Kirok! I have come! I am Kirok! Miramanee! My wife. Is she all right? Miramanee. No! Miramanee! No! Miramanee! I am Kirok! I am It worked. Yes. What's inside is loaded with scientific equipment. McCoy. I don't know how to get inside. The key must be in these symbols. We've got to decipher them. You mean entry can be gained by playing certain notes on a musical instrument? Give me your communicator. Tonal control, consonants and vowels. I must have hit it accidentally when I contacted the ship. Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty, if the deflector isn't activated within twenty minutes, get out of orbit. Get the Enterprise out of the danger zone. The landing party is expendable. The Enterprise isn't. Kirk out. Miramanee. Bones, stay with her. Do what you can. Careful. I must have hit something accidentally. A beam caught me and that's when I stopped remembering. More symbols. Can you read them? Spock, just press the right button. How is she? Will she live? And so are your people, Miramanee. If that's what you want. And I'll love you, Miramanee. Always.",81

I think you could use some rest. Nurse Chapel will see you to your quarters. Tommy, Just a moment. I'd like to ask you a question. Come and sit down. Tommy, will you tell me what you saw? In the cave, on the planet. On Triacus. Did you see your father today? Did he seem upset? What about? What was going on that would have upset him? I'm not upset with you, Tommy, or your friends. We invited you aboard the Enterprise. Why would I do that if I didn't like you? Aren't you unhappy about leaving Triacus? Aren't you upset about leaving your parents? Yes, certainly. I'll take you. Kirk to security. Post a guard on the children. They're to be kept under constant watch. Lieutenant Uhura, any report from the planet security team? Good. Let's see them. Let's see some more of these unscientific hypotheses, Mister Spock. What happened? I didn't see you come in, Tommy. No. We'll probably take you to a Federation Starbase. I'm sorry, Tommy. Marcos Twelve is not within our patrol area. Mister Spock, we'll pursue this in my quarters. All right, Tommy. Lieutenant, have Doctor McCoy report to my quarters for a brief conference. Mister Leslie? That could be what destroyed him. Misleading the innocent? I wonder. Yes, Doctor. Spock what do we know about the race that lived here? Is that the end of it? Is it possible that the evil found the catalyst? But most legends have their basis in fact, Spock. I understand your diagnosis, Doctor, and I'll respect it. But not to the exclusion and safety of the Enterprise. Thank you. Spock, what other expeditions have visited Triacus? What was it Professor Starnes said about the unseen force? A ship. Yes, a ship for Triacus. But why? By whom? Security detachment. Ready for relief duty on Triacus. Assemble in the transporter room immediately. I'll have some questions for that planet detachment as soon as they're beamed up. I think it's about time we found out whether Professor Starnes' enemy within is on the planet below or here onboard ship with us. Come on. Your tour of duty will last one hour. Be prepared with your communicators at all times to report any alien beings. Don't wait to investigate. Beam up the security detachment from Triacus. Spock? What's wrong? Why not? That's impossible. If we're not orbiting Triacus, then the men I beamed down are dead. Activate the bridge monitor screen. Captain to Bridge. Mister Sulu, we're not orbiting Triacus. You're off course. I'm coming right up. Sulu! Helmsman, disregard what you see on the screen, what you think you see on the screen. Set a course for Starbase Four. Helmsman, did you hear me? Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starbase Four. Tell them we're bringing the children there. Tell Starfleet Command I suspect them of being alien in nature, and I want a thorough investigation made upon our arrival. Lieutenant, what are you staring at? Lieutenant, there's nothing there. Mister Spock, you make the call to Starfleet. Mister Sulu, I ordered you to change course. Mister Sulu Mister Sulu, there's nothing there. That was an order, Spock. Complete? Take a look around you. Take Mister Sulu to his quarters. He is relieved of duty. Confine them to quarters. Did you hear me? Did you hear me? Yes, we must. I'm losing command. I'm losing my ability to command. I'm losing the Enterprise. I'm losing command. I'm losing the Enterprise. The ship is sailing on and on. I'm alone. Alone. Alone. I'm losing command. I've lost command. I've lost the Enterprise. I've got command. I've got command. I've got command. Auxiliary control, my Vulcan friend. This ship is off course. Scotty. I want you to override the bridge navigation system and plot a course for Starbase Four. Why not? Scotty, listen to me. The Enterprise has been invaded by alien beings. Its destination is Marcos. If we take it there, millions will die the way they died at Triacus. No, I'm all right, Spock. My beast is finished. It won't return. Spock, they're not the alien beings. They're children being misled. They're children. They don't understand the evil that they're doing. We'll have to kill them. What is it, Ensign? By whose order? Where did you hear this order, Ensign? Now, listen to me. This order is false. I want you and your men to return to their stations. Ensign, listen to me. Ensign, listen to me. This is a false order, Ensign. I know that, Ensign. You have never disobeyed an order, but an alien being is aboard this ship. Ensign, listen to me. You will disobey this order! Enough. Take these men to detention then join me on the bridge. The Enterprise will never reach Marcos Twelve. We will not be landing there. The crew does not understand. When we make them understand as I understand, they won't take you to Marcos. Your friend? Where is your friend? Where is that stowaway? Why does he hide? Good. I'm glad you're not afraid of me. But your leader is afraid. What's he afraid of? He's afraid to be seen. And when the crew sees and hears him, they'll understand that he is not their friend, and they won't follow him. Then let him show himself. Bring him out! Let him prove to me that he is my friend and I'll follow him to Marcos Twelve and to the ends of the universe! Mister Spock, playback the chant the children sang to summon up the Gorgan. The time has come to see the world as it is. Come on. I did, Gorgan. My beast is gone. It lost its power in the light of reality. I command again, and I ordered you here. And we know you. Not if we join together to fight you. We're also very strong. Children, I have pictures of some of you on Triacus. I'd like to show them to you. Would you like to see them? Mister Spock, the pictures. So we were told. Mister Spock, the pictures. The children are waiting. Not always, Gorgan. Not this time. You can't hide from them. They see you as we see you. They know what you are. Even the children learn. Don't be afraid. Look at him. Without you children, he's nothing. The evil remains within him. Look how ugly he really is. Look at him and don't be afraid. It's all right. It's all right, Mary. It's all right. It's all right, isn't it, Doctor? Reverse course, Mister Sulu. Set course for Starbase Four, Mister Sulu.",131

Bones, why hadn't you told me? Yes, there's a great deal to respect about that lady. Am I addressing the Ambassador? We don't hold you to blame for what happened, and thank you now for your help. Yes. Mister Sulu, release the helm to Mister Spock. Then go ahead, Mister Spock. Take over, Mister Sulu. Thank you, Ambassador. Mister Chekov, plot a new course. Ambassador, you must dissolve the link. There must be no delay. Spock! Don't look! Cover your eyes! Don't move! No one is to move. Spock? Are you all right? Vulcan mind techniques. They seem so untrustworthy now that Spock's life is at stake. But does she want to? She's been in there so long. She tried to help Marvick. Marvick is dead. And Spock is her rival. Is that any better? Even Spock felt the violence of her jealousy. Whatever happens, Bones, don't interfere. Captain Kirk. No change? What are you doing about it? Which doesn't seem to be much. It's worth a try, isn't it? After all, he's not a machine. Only half. The other half is human. Far more human than you, apparently. If you don't reach him soon, he'll die. But that's what you want, isn't it? Oh yes? You want him to die. What did you do to him on the Bridge? Did you make him forget to put the visor over his eyes? Yes, you know your rival, don't you? You couldn't keep him from making a mind-link with Kollos, something you couldn't do yourself! With my words, I'll make you hear such ugliness as Spock saw when he looked at Kollos with his naked eyes! The ugliness is within you! Your desire to see Kollos is madness! You can never see him. Never. But Spock saw Kollos, and for that he must die. The smell of hatred, the stench of jealousy permeates you. Why don't you strangle him while he lies there? Kollos knows what's in your heart. You can lie to yourself, but you can't lie to Kollos. Maybe too much. You may be right, Bones. Maybe I shouldn't have gone in. She was blind, really blind. Really in the dark. And if he dies. If he dies, how do I know that I didn't kill him? How do I know that she can stand to hear the truth? Spock. Miranda. I didn't think you'd even talk to me. Miranda, good luck, Health. I have something for you. I never met a rose that didn't. Peace.",113

I'm all right. Are you all right, Mister Spock? Oh, that Oracle really got to me. I must be especially susceptible to its magic spells. Well, we'd better get to the control room. Don't worry. I can make it, Jim. Gentlemen, I believe we have a visitor. It tastes like an ancient herb derivative. There's something under the skin. He's dead. Oh, no. I'm quite all right, thank you. Well, now. Nobody can blame her for that, can they? Perhaps not. You are very kind. No, thank you. I'm curious. How did the Oracle punish the old man? There is some way the Oracle knows what you say, isn't there? It's all right. I suppose we had to learn the power of the Oracle. Honesty is usually wise. No, there isn't. Oh, yes. Yes, I do. We do. But we're strangers to each other. Yes. How long will it take you to reach this new world? If you only knew how I needed some kind of future, Natira. Yes, very lonely. There's something I need to tell you. But there is. I have an illness for which there is no cure. I have one year to live. What are you going to do to my friends? And the punishment is death? They acted out of ignorance, Natira. Please let them return to the ship. For me? I've made my decision. I'm staying here, on Yonada. Natira, what they did, they did because they felt they had to. Please, let them return to the ship. You won't regret it. How do you think I'd feel if I stayed here with the chance to be happy for the first time in my life, but knowing my friends had died? No, I'm not. I'm on a kind of a collision course myself, Jim. And I refuse. I intend to stay on this ship, with these people, whatever happens. Is it, Mister Spock? Is it really? Natira's asked me to stay, and I'm staying. Yes. Is that too much to ask, Jim? I do. Let it be done. We're now of one mind. One life. Do the people know the contents of their book?

Then your fears about that phaser were correct. It blasted a hole right through that crazy space fabric, and only heaven knows where it sent the Defiant. That'll be about twenty minutes. Aye, she'll be back together. But we'll only have about eighty percent power built up. What have you got there? What is it? Aye. And deadly, too. What are you thinking of, Doc?

Sacrifice yourself by agreeing to stay, and you sign our death warrant. Put it down. Put it down. Do what I say. Give it to me! In that case, what's the point in you dying too, Alexander? Give it to me. That's all right. It's all right, Alexander. Listen, we haven't given up, and there may be something you can do to help. All right. Did the Platonians always have this power? Bones, I think it'd be a good idea if you took a reading of Alexander's blood. You still have a tricorder reading of Parmen's blood, don't you? And if our theory works out, we've got a weapon. Kironide. It's a high-energy source. That could be it. Exactly. McCoy, there must be a quick way of building up a concentration of kironide in our blood. What are we waiting for? What is it, Bones? Yes. There are thirty eight of them. Let's not any waste time. Give us double the concentration in Parmen's bloodstream. Yes. What about Alexander? Why not? You could conceivably take Parmen's place and run the whole planet. Alexander. Nurse. Lieutenant Uhura. I guess we weren't sufficiently entertaining. Spock, do you feel any effect of the kironide shot? So did l. Let's try a simple test. Concentrate on raising this plate of fruit. Nothing. Not yet, Parmen. You have to convince the doctor first. That's the way they want you to feel. It makes them think that they're alive. Try not to think of them. Try. You're half dead, all of you! You've been dead for centuries. We may disappear tomorrow, but at least we're living now, and you can't stand that, can you? You're half crazy because there's nothing inside. Nothing. And you have to torture us to convince yourselves you're superior. I did. Platonians, listen to me. The next one of you that tries any trick will get hurt. Not only do we have your psychokinetic abilities, but at twice your power level. Do you want to be like him? To us, killing is murder, even for revenge. But there will be other starships. I don't believe you. Just remember, we can recreate that power in a matter of hours, so don't try anything. You're very good at making speeches, Parmen. Just make sure that this one sinks in. Now move aside. Alexander. Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott, prepare to beam us up. I have a little surprise for you. I'm bringing a visitor aboard.",95

A race of mutes, like the civilisation on Gamma Vertis Four. Without speech, how's she going to be able to understand us? Unless she's a telepath. Do you have any ideas? I want to know why we're here. I want to know what's going on. And she knows. I'm Captain Who are you? Why did you bring us here? What do you intend to do with us? We come Since you already know who we are, you must also know that we come in peace. Our prime directive specifically prohibits us from any interference.) I can't seem to stand up. Mister Spock there must be an exit other than the one we just saw. Don't worry about me. They may have hurt her. Did they hurt you? The pain is gone. She touched my head, and the pain is gone. Thank you. Details. Well they're there now. Let's go check them out. Staying here alone could be dangerous. Come with us. Bones Spock, come here. I found our missing men. Dead. Another one of your experiments? Yes. Your time is running out. This sun is about to nova. When it does, it'll destroy you, this planet, and this insane torture chamber. Let's get out of here. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise, come in. Out of range. Readings, Mister Spock? Let's get there as fast as we can. If the Enterprise has a search party, it'll be there. Spock! Much further? Scotty! Stay there! Come on! Keep going. What are you doing here? Where's Scotty? What about the others? Very well. Denied. You have your orders. What happened to my men? One specimen, you said. One specimen! What happened to my men? Where are they? Tell me! You said you'd let them go! What is it you want to know? You don't need any knowledge from us, yet you're willing to kill for it. Is that what happened to Linke and Ozaba? Well, what did you expect from them? And what do you want from me? Why? What is it you hope to prove? If my death is to have any meaning, at least tell me what I'm dying for. Will she live? Can you explain what happened? She weakened. I could feel it. Is her life in danger? Could the strain really have killed her? I'm tired. I remember the laboratory, and they wanted to know something. But I, I can't remember. What's the matter with me? You'll have to ask the Vians. Will I live? No, he's right. Continue. Can you tap into it? And get us out of here the same way we were brought in. Then I would say proceed. It is. We will not co-operate. How's it coming, Spock? Take it easy, Bones. And space travel is? The decision's mine. If there are any decisions to be made, I'll make them. If and when it becomes necessary. I don't need any Why did you let him do it? Anything? What exactly is it? Can you adapt it, re-attune it to fit our brain pattern? Do whatever you have to to make it work, Spock. What disturbs me is why the Vians let us keep it. And that we would use it to escape. And they keep McCoy. Somehow, you're the crux, the focal point of all this. Even before we got here, she was a prisoner. They didn't hurt her, they didn't even threaten her. Yes, there is a purpose, but what is it? Has all the pain and terror happened, or been made to happen for you? Will it take us to McCoy? The best defence is a strong offense, and I intend to start offending right now. Aim for the lab. Bones. Spock. Get him down. His wrists. His pulse is almost gone. How is he? Don't talk. Don't speak. Take it easy until we get you back to the ship. What is it? What's the matter? You don't know. You're not a doctor. How long? Can't we do something? Gem might be able to help him, the way she helped me, but could his nearness to death also kill her? If she could just strengthen him and keep him from sinking further into death, we might be able to save him. She can save his life. Let us help her to go to him. What purpose can all this serve, except the fulfilment of some need of yours? Patient? Our friend is dying. This arena of death that you have devised for your pleasure. Will it prevent this catastrophe? How will the death of our friend serve this purpose? We were? What could she learn from us? Then you cannot let him die. Yes, Bones. What is it? Yes, I know. I'll try. Yes. You must save the life of our friend. If death is all you understand, here are four lives for you. We will not leave our friend. You've lost the capacity to feel the emotions you brought Gem here to experience. You don't understand what it is to live. Love and compassion are dead in you. You're nothing but intellect. Strange. I'm not puzzled, Mister Spock. I am awed. No, no. I wasn't thinking of Gem. I was thinking of that fantastic element of chance that out in limitless space we should come together with Gem. What, Scott? Yes, she was all that. And whether the Vians bought her or found her makes little difference. She was of great value. Mister Spock, can you be prevailed upon to bring them the news?

That's the first problem we're going to work on. Then we'll get you ready to go to Troyius. You enjoy the privileges and prerogatives of being a Dohlman. Then be worthy of them. If you don't want the obligations that go along with the title, then give it up. That's another one of your problems. Nobody's told you that you're an uncivilized savage, a vicious child in a woman's body, an arrogant monster! That's no way to treat someone who's telling you the truth. Tomorrow's lesson will be on courtesy. Lieutenant, open up the hailing frequency, identify us, and ask the Klingon his intentions. I see. All right, Lieutenant. Monitor all frequencies. Phaser crews stand by. Maintain Yellow Alert. Where's Kryton? Will you tell Her Glory that Captain Kirk requests the honour of a visit. Thank you, Mister Spock. When they wake up, take them to Security holding. Mister Spock, the women on your planet are logical. That's the only planet in this galaxy that can make that claim. Only in self-defence. Now, are you going to behave or not? We're not on Elas. We're on my starship. I command here. If I touch you again, Your Glory, it'll be to administer an ancient Earth custom called a spanking, a form of punishment administered to spoiled brats. You forget, Your Glory, we haven't started your lesson in courtesy. Very well. I'll send in Mister Spock or Doctor McCoy. Either way, you're going to be properly prepared for Troyius. As ordered by councils, rulers, and bureaucrats. No, no, you were right the first time. There's nothing I can teach you. There's nothing you do not know. Well, it's not it's not that people hate you. It's just that people don't like to be treated as though they don't exist. It's, er, gotten very, er. Something must've gone wrong with the ventilation system. Pardon me, Your Glory. There will be a short recess. It's, er, It's, er. We'll talk about it later. Kirk here. Inside the Enterprise? Can you pinpoint it? Security to Engineering. Intruder alert. Security alert to all decks. Kirk out. It's Klingon. Bones? What kind of signal did you send the Klingon ship? Yes, I'm aware you're trained to resist any form of physical torture. Kirk to Spock. Mister Spock, it was Kryton transmitting. He refuses to talk. I'll need you for the Vulcan mind meld. What was he trying to cover that was so important he felt he had to die for it? Scotty, he didn't come into Engineering just to use the transmitter. I want you to check every relay you've got. Don't waste the time telling me about it. Get to it. He sold out to the Klingons because of jealousy? There's a Klingon warship out there. What's their involvement? Surely all of this isn't because they want to stop a marriage. Elaan. Elaan, two planets, an entire star system's stability depends on it. We have a duty to forget what happened. My orders and yours say that you belong to another man. What happened, what happened was an accident. What kind of a mind could think of such a thing? What? It's true. Bones, you've got to find me an antidote. Captain here. I'm on my way. Battle stations. Phasers stand by. Mister Chekov, lay in a course to take us out of this star system. If they want to fight, Let's get some manoeuvering room. All right. Ahead warp factor two. Belay that order. What is it, Scotty? Scotty, that bomb he planted. Can you dismantle it? Give us every ounce of power you can from the impulse drive, and find a solution to the bomb. Kirk out. Mister Sulu, stand by to make your manoeuvres smartly. She'll be sluggish on response. Phaser crews, stand by to fire on command. Ready. Hold your fire. Yes, their tactics are quite clear now, Mister Spock. They were trying to make us cut in warp drive. That way we'd have blown ourselves up and solved their problem for them without risking war with the Federation. Very neat. Yes, a very good question, Mister Spock. I'll be the judge. Yes, you're quite right. Thank you, Mister Spock. I want you to go to Sickbay. It's the best protected part of the ship. Your presence here is interfering with my efficiency, my ability to protect you. Mister Spock, you have the conn. Deck five. If I can accomplish my mission by turning tail and running, I'll gladly do that. Yes. Yes, Elaan. No. Kirk here. No chance of restoring warp drive? Kirk out. Elaan, I have to go back to the Bridge. Please, you must go to Sickbay. They're trying to force a fight. Scotty, what's our energy status? And let the Klingons know they succeeded in wiping out our warp engines? We'll stall for time, proceed on course and hope the Klingons can be bluffed. Or that they're not prepared for a general war. Open a hailing frequency. This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise on Federation business. Our mission is peaceful, but we're not prepared to accept any interference. I'd say our strategy wasn't totally effective. Scotty, can you give me partial power on the phaser banks? I told you to stay in Sickbay. We're not going to die. Now get off the bridge. Mister Sulu, bring her to one four three mark two. Keep our forward shields to him. Stay with the controls. Keep our forward shields to him. Hard over, Sulu. Bring her around. He's going for our flank. Sulu! How bad? What sort of readings, Mister Spock? Elaan? What kind of jewels are in this? Common stones? Now I see why the Klingons are interested in this system. May I have this? You may have just saved our lives. Mister Spock, do you think Scotty could make use of dilithium crystals? Mister Sulu, prepare on my order to turn quickly to port. Try and protect the number four shield. Now, Sulu. hard a-port! Lieutenant Uhura, open a hailing frequency. This is Captain James Kirk of the United Spaceship Enterprise. May I request your terms for surrender? Scotty, your estimate. Test it in combat. Let me know when it's in place. Open a hailing frequency. This is the Enterprise. Will you guarantee the safety of our passenger, the Dohlman from Elas? You and Spock get up here. Sulu, prepare for warp manoeuvres. Chekov, arm photon torpedoes. Negative. His sensors will pick up our power increase. The more helpless he thinks we are, the closer he'll come. As he passes, I want to cut in warp drive. We'll pivot at warp two and bring all tubes to bear. Mister Chekov, give him a full spread of photon torpedoes. Scotty, stand by to cut in warp drive. Fire at minimum range. Warp in, Scotty. Full power to shields. Warp factor two. Bring us to course one four eight mark three. Chekov, photon torpedoes. Fire! Secure from general quarters. Well done, Mister Sulu. Scotty. No. Mister Sulu, resume course for Troyius. No. I have no choice. Goodbye. Energise. Mister Sulu, prepare to take us out of orbit. Ahead warp factor two.",164

A dream that became a reality and spread throughout the stars, a dream that made Mister Spock and me brothers. No thank you. I prefer to join Mister Spock. Occasionally. I'm sure you're aware that there are an infinite number of countermoves. I can't for the life of me imagine which one. Dead I am of no use to you. Yes, I think it's very good. I can't. Yes, I recognise it. It's used for rehabilitation purposes. Stop it! No. Is this more of Garth's persuasion, Marta? I believe you mean that. Marta. Marta, I can help you, but I must get to the Enterprise to do that. Yes, it is. It is if I can get to the control room and remove the force field, then Garth is finished. He will lead you to destruction. He's already destroyed the medicine that could have helped you. But there's more medicine aboard the ship. Spock? How did you manage that? I'm very glad to see you. Yes, you presume correctly. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott, I want a fully armed security detail beamed down here on the double. And have Doctor McCoy prepare additional medicine as quickly as possible. Very well, Spock. Scotty, Mister Spock will give the countersign. What have you done with Spock? Where is he? Captain Garth No, sir. Captain Garth, Starship fleet Captain. That's an honourable title. Yes, you were. Yes. But you're a sick man now, sir. No. No, think. Think back to what you were before the accident that sent you to Antos Four. Try. No, I, I can remember. You were the finest student at the Academy, the finest Starship Captain. You were the prototype, the model for the rest of us. And you bore it well. And the disease that changed you, it's not your fault. And the terrible things you did since then, not truly responsible. No, I'm not. I want you to find what you once had. I want you to go back to the greatness that you've lost, Captain Garth. No, sir, listen to me. I No. Coronation? Yes, I agree. You'll wear a crown too, I presume? Garth, you have only a handful of men. No, I wouldn't enjoy that at all. Besides, you seem to need me alive. Listen to me. This may be our last chance. Garth will destroy all of us unless you help me stop him. And he's using you, you know that, because he wants the power for himself. I brought something that might have cured you, but he destroyed it. If I can get a patrol down, they'd bring more of that medicine and All I can say, Garth, if it happens to me, it happens to you. I'm your Captain, Spock! Can't you tell? Shoot! Shoot! He's right, Spock. You must shoot, but shoot both of us. It's the only way to ensure the safety of the Enterprise. Mister Spock. Captain Garth, I'm James Kirk. The starship Enterprise. Yes, sir, the Enterprise. I'm the captain. Can I help? No, Captain. No. Mister Spock. Tell me something. Why was it so impossible to tell the difference between us? Yes, and congratulations. What took you so long? I see. Mister Spock. Letting yourself be hit on the head, and I presume you let yourself be hit on the head, is not exactly a method King Solomon would have approved. Mister Scott, ready to beam up.",95

You are free to move about the ship. I hope that you'll take the opportunity to know more about the Federation through its best representatives, my crew. But let me make it clear. I will stand for no interference with the function of this ship. All hands, return to normal routine. Captain out. We try, sir. That's enough for today. Those two are beginning to affect you. I expect the answer is already on its way. Let's do that. No, Commissioner. The one thing we're agreed upon is that Lokai took a shuttlecraft. Excuse me. Kirk here. Yes, read it. That's enough. Thank you. Now, wait a minute, Commissioner, I can assure you, Commissioner, that our minds will not be twisted, not by Lokai, nor by you. You're black on one side and white on the other. I fail to see the significant difference. Let Lokai state his grievances. Hear him, listen to him. Maybe he can change. Maybe he wants to change his image. There must have been a time, long ago no doubt, when that was true. Excuse me. Kirk here. Very good. Commence decontamination procedures when ready. Advise when complete. Kirk here. Good. Repeat procedure for maximum effect. Kirk here. Very good. We'll be right up. Set directional controls for Starbase Four. Kirk out. Will you join us on the bridge? Can you determine which ones? At the moment, I seem to have no choice. After so many years of leading the fight, you seem very much alive. Bele, you keep this up, and you'll never get to Cheron with your prisoner. The rest of this ship will be irreparably damaged. This will be your final battlefield. Your fifty thousand years of pursuit will have been wasted. And you, Lokai, will die here in space. You'll inspire no more disciples. Your cause will be ended. You've made your point. I understand. Will you return the Enterprise to my control? Scotty, have repairs on directional control been completed? Check controls and co-ordinates. Is it within visual range? Chekov, put it on the screen. Extreme magnification. What are you picking up? You mean, all the people are dead? Yes, Commissioner, all of them. Stop it! What's the matter with you two? Didn't you hear Spock? Your planet is dead! There's nobody alive on Cheron because of hate. The cause you fought about no longer exists. Give yourselves time to breathe. Give up your hate. You're welcome to live with us. Listen to me. You both must end up dead if you don't stop hating. Bele. The chase is finished. Bele. No, Lieutenant. Where can they run? Spock, anyone in the transporter room? There's nobody there to try him. His judges are all dead. Of course. No, but that's all they have left. Warp factor two, Mister Sulu. Set course for Starbase Four.",151

Admiral, I wish to state for the record that your decision is completely arbitrary. They did not ask for our understanding, Doctor. Unfortunately, I must violate a direct order from Starfleet. I do not make it lightly, Doctor. However, Command knows that Ambassador Hodin has not been totally honest with us. Lieutenant Uhura, repeat original Gideon co-ordinates for beam down. Mister Scott, the co-ordinates given you? Precisely. I shall beam down at once. Mister Scott, you have the conn. Negative, Doctor. I cannot accept the responsibility for ordering a fellow officer to violate a Starfleet directive. I can make such a decision only for myself. The situation forces me to do so, Doctor. This will not take long. Captain Kirk. Spock here. Captain Kirk? An exact duplicate of the Enterprise. But completely inoperative. Spock to Enterprise. Spock to Enterprise. I am speaking to you from the bridge of the Enterprise. On the bridge of the Enterprise, Mister Scott. And they were correct. I'm on board an exact duplicate of the Enterprise. In orbit, Doctor. In a manner of speaking, Gideon is in orbit and the ship is on Gideon. I'm sure he's on board somewhere. I'm picking up life readings. Spock out. Your Excellency. Captain, you're looking well. Evidently Starfleet's analysis was correct. Spock to Enterprise. Spock to Enterprise. Three to beam up, Mister Scott. Negative. Lock in on my communicator signal. Your Excellency, please do not interfere. I already have one serious problem to resolve with upper echelons.",76

Are there men on this planet? No! Bones, did you see that? Maybe Spock was wrong. Perhaps this is a ghost planet. Yes, I know. That's a good question. She touched the transporter chief. He collapsed immediately. She apparently got to D'Amato. We saw what happened to him. The question is, why are you alive? The power to totally disrupt biological cell structure. Sulu's alive because I intervened. But that raises an even worse question. She's not through yet. Lieutenant Sulu, do you feel strong enough to move about? Is he, Bones? All right. Whatever destructive power this woman has seems to be aimed at one specific person at one specific time. If I'm correct, when she re-appears, the other two might protect the one she's after by interposing their bodies. No weapons seem to affect her. Controls are fused. Drop! Apparently she can destroy our weapons as well as destroy us. Come on, let's go. Yes. Like a door opening. Who have you come for this time? Why do you want to kill us? Then why do you want to kill me? We're here on a peaceful mission. It's you who have killed our people. We mean no harm to you. We want to leave, peacefully. An android? Who are you? Commander of what? Station? Station? Where? How do you feel about killing me? Stay between us. You want to kill me? Then why do it if you don't want to? By whom? Are there others on this planet? How long have you been alone? Are you lonely? And there's this power surge, right off the scale. Like a door closing. It must be near here. Right off the scale. It's remained at a peak ever since she disappeared. The entrance is here. It certainly looks like it. And the invitation doesn't exactly relax me. I agree. I don't know. But whatever civilisation exists on this planet is in there. And without the Enterprise, gentlemen, the only source of food and water is in there. Let's go. Who have you come for? Form a circle. You see? You'd better tell us. Tell us. Who have you come for? Who have you come for? You're a very determined woman. For me? Gentlemen, I need your help. We've seen the results of your touch. That is how you kill. You'll never reach me. That computer must be programming these replicas. Shift positions. Spock, the computer! Destroy it! Mister Spock, I certainly am glad to see you. I thought you and the Enterprise had been destroyed. Returned from where? Was, Mister Spock. Its defences were run by computer. There were replicas of one of them. But that power to recreate them has been destroyed. Well, you wouldn't have thought so, Mister Spock, if you'd been among us. The computer was too perfect. It projected so much of Losira's personality into the replica that it felt regret, guilt, at killing. That bought us the time we needed to destroy it. She must have been a remarkable woman. Kirk to Enterprise. Five to beam up. I don't agree with you, Mister Spock. Beauty survives.",97

Make sure it's not overheating. I didn't ask you to check the board, lad. Oh, you poor lad. Scott to bridge. Scott to bridge. My assistant, Watkins, is dead. I didn't see it happen, but his last words were a warning cry about some strange woman. You mean that one of the people who threw us a thousand light years away from that planet is on board and killing our people? Then you're right, Mister Spock. Watkins must've been murdered. I sent him in to check the matter-antimatter reactor. There are no exposed circuits there. It couldn't have been anything he touched. Bridge to Engineering. Scotty here. I see it. It's a power surge. I'm working on it. Reduce speed until I locate the trouble. Aye, Mister Spock, and I found out why. The emergency bypass control of the matter-antimatter integrator is fused. It's completely useless. The engines are running wild. There's no way to get at them. We should reach maximum overload in about fifteen minutes. Those few seconds will not make any difference, Mister Spock, because you and I and the rest of the crew will no longer be here to bandy it back and forth. This thing is going to blow up And there's nothing in the universe can stop it. It's useless. And there's no question it's deliberate. Aye, and a thorough job. The system's foolproof. Whoever murdered Watkins sabotaged this. That's what worries me. Well, it's fused, all right, but it would take all the power of our main phaser banks to do it. I find nothing interesting in the fact that we're about to blow up. Whatever did this is still aboard this ship. I fail to understand why you cancelled the security alert. Aye. There's a service crawlway, but it's not meant to be used while the integrator operates. What with? Bare hands? Any matter that comes in contact with antimatter triggers the explosion. And I'm not even sure a man can live in the crawlway in the energy stream of the magnetic field that bottles up the antimatter. You'll be killed, man! Aye. You're right. What have we got to lose? But I'll do it, Mister Spock. I know every millimetre of that system. I'll do whatever has to be done. Aye. It was an emotional statement. I don't expect you to understand it. Mister Spock, we don't have time for that. All right, lads. Get the crawlway door open. Hand me the tools. Communicator. All right. Head first. I hope Mister Spock knows what he's doing. Scott to Bridge. I've sealed off the aft end of the service crawlway, and I've positioned explosive separator charges to blast me clear of the ship if I rupture the magnetic bottle. I'm so close to the flow now it feels like ants crawling all over my body. I heard that. The ship's not structured to take that speed for any length of time. All right, Mister Spock. I'm starting to open the access panel now. Access to the flow itself. If the magnetic flow jumps, you must jettison me. The safety control Will not hold more than two seconds if I rupture the field. I've removed the access plate, and I've got static electric charges dancing on the instruments. Looks like an aurora borealis in there. It's hard to see. There's so much disturbance that any attempt to get at the flow would rupture the magnetic field. I know what time it is. I don't need a blooming' cuckoo clock. Mister Spock. I'm going to try to cut through the magnetic flow. But if the probe doesn't precisely match the magnetic flow, there'll be an explosion. Starting right now. Reverse polarity? That'll take some doing. What purpose could it I have no time for theory. I just hope you're right. I'm doing the best I can! Wait! It's stuck! It's stuck! Push the button! Don't be a fool! Push the button! It's your last chance! Don't be sentimental, push it. I'm going to die anyway. It's loose! But there's no time. Push the button! You might at least say thank you. Never mind.",61

At her age, I rather enjoyed errors with no noticeable damage, but I must admit you're the farthest thing from a bookworm I've ever seen. The misfortune of men everywhere, and our privilege. Thank you, sir. Yes, there's something wrong. The ryetalyn is no good. It contains irillium, nearly one part per thousand. Thank you. Nearly two and a half hours. I guess we've got time to get in under the wire. I've never seen anything like the speed of that robot. It'd take us twice as long to process that stuff. Jim, what if all the ryetalyn on this planet contains irillium? Like a hawk. I tell you, Spock, I was waiting for the robot to finish the processing, and the next thing I knew it was gone and so was the ryetalyn. Well, I think we'd better tell Jim. Flint lied. The ryetalyn isn't here. Why? Get to the point, Spock, if there is one. The ryetalyn. Physically human but not human. These are earlier versions of Rayna, Jim. She's an android. Instant tissue regeneration coupled with some perfect form of biological renewal. You learned that you were immortal and You have been such men. You've known and created such beauty. You've watched your race evolve from cruelty and barbarism throughout your enormous life, and yet now you would do this to us? All emotions are in play, Mister Flint. You harm us, she hates you. Jim. Oh, thank heaven, sleeping at last. Yes, I told him myself. He intends to devote the remainder of his years and great abilities to the improvement of the human condition. And who knows what he might come up with. Well, I guess that's all. I can tell Jim later or you can. Considering his opponent's longevity, truly an eternal triangle. You wouldn't understand that, would you, Spock? You see, I feel sorrier for you than I do for him because you'll never know the things that love can drive a man to. The ecstasies, the miseries, the broken rules, the desperate chances, the glorious failures, the glorious victories. All of these things you'll never know simply because the word love isn't written into your book. Goodnight, Spock. I do wish he could forget her.",36

They've already been provided to the transport officer, Captain. Along with those of the council chamber of the High Advisor. Stratos, Captain. A city actually floating in the sky. It is one of the most interesting metropolises in the galaxy. Have you ever visited here, Captain? I've never had the opportunity. However, I hear its art forms are incomparable. It is a totally intellectual society. All forms of violence have been eliminated. Perhaps there is another entrance, Captain. It would seem the Troglytes have changed their minds about delivery. Greetings, Mister Advisor. The Disrupters? Who are they? Remarkable. The finest example of sustained antigravity elevation I've ever seen. Nor I a work of art, madam. Despoil? For what purpose? Mister Advisor, the plant life is the source of oxygen on that planet. Obviously, if all plant life is destroyed, the humanoid life will follow. But why do they destroy art forms? That is a loss to everyone. That would be most welcome, Mister Advisor. This troubled planet is a place of the most violent contrasts. Those who receive the rewards are totally separated from those who shoulder the burdens. It is not a wise leadership. Here on Stratos, everything is incomparably beautiful and pleasant. The High Advisor's charming daughter Droxine, particularly so. The name Droxine seems appropriate for her. I wonder, can she retain such purity and sweetness of mind and be aware of the life of the people on the surface of the planet? There, the harsh life in the mines is instilling the people with a bitter hatred. The young girl who led the attack against us when we beamed down was filled with the violence of desperation. If the lovely Droxine knew of the young miner's misery, I wonder how the knowledge would affect her. Your movements awakened me. Only Vulcan ears would find the noise discernible. The same may be said of Stratos inhabitants. We do pride ourselves on our logic. The seven-year cycle is biologically inherent in all Vulcan's. At that time, the mating drive outweighs all other motivations. Extreme feminine beauty is always disturbing, madam. Am I intruding, Captain? In other words, they perform all the physical toil necessary to maintain Stratos. But they are not allowed to share its advantages. The surface of the planet is almost unendurable. To restrict a segment of the population to such hardship is unthinkable in an evolved culture. Troglyte is an abbreviation of an ancient Earth term. Its technical translation is cave dweller. Violence in reality is quite different from theory, is it not, madam? All the little things you and I understand and expect from life, such as equality, kindness, justice. But they're all the same species. Those who live on Stratos and those who live below all originated on the planet. Their physical and mental evolution must be similar. That is basic biological law. Incredible. Zenite is shipped all over the galaxy wherever there is danger of plant bacteria. No side effects have ever been reported. As part of the staff of Stratos, Vanna was removed from exposure for a long period. It is likely that without such exposure, the effect slowly wears off. Unequal evolution did not begin until after your ancestors removed themselves from constant exposure to the gas, Mister Advisor. Nor much time. We have ten hours and forty minutes to deliver that consignment to Merak Two. Captain, if you are apprehended deliberately violating the High Advisor's orders, he will be within his rights to have you executed, if he chooses. Allow me to point out that a first officer is more expendable than either a doctor or a captain. Spock here. We've been trying to make contact, Captain. Is anything wrong? Locked in and ready to beam up consignment. Standing by for instructions. Instructions clear. I shall carry them out immediately. Spock out. That's not an exact quote, Mister Scott. However, it does express the thought. You will have that opportunity. Now that is an exact quote, Mister Scott, and I suggest you handle the transporter yourself. This could be very delicate as a problem in transporting for us and in diplomacy for the captain. Spock here. You'll have to delay. Picking up two life-forms in the gallery. They are inseparably close to one another. We cannot transport one Without the other. Precisely, Mister Scott. Until the High Advisor is alone or can be isolated, the captain will have to wait. Unless you have an alternative? Spock to transporter room. Lock in on Council Gallery co-ordinates. Energise. How are you doing, Mister Scott? Beam him down to Captain Kirk immediately. Good work, Mister Scott. The captain will employ his usual diplomatic balm. Contact check, Captain. It has been over an hour since your last communication. Standing by, Captain. However, let me remind you, we have only five hours left to That is very unlike the captain. Enterprise, Spock here. Captain, the zenite gas has affected you. Captain! The zenite gas! It is less technical, therefore less accurate, but perhaps more generally descriptive of the function. There is great beauty in the knowledge that lies below, and only one way to really experience it. No. No, Vulcan is quite different. Two hours, fifty-nine minutes to be exact, Captain.",68
