Place them on ready status. Now hear this. Print-out message, urgent, all stations on all decks. Prepare for emergency saucer sever. You will command the saucer section, Lieutenant. You are a Starfleet officer, Lieutenant. Make the mark, Data. Note in ship's log that at this startime, I'm transferring command to the battle bridge. Lieutenant, your torpedoes must detonate close enough to the hostile to blind it at the moment we separate. Worf, this is the Captain. At the moment of separation, we will reverse power just enough to get your saucer section out ahead and clear of us. Begin countdown. Mark. Let's come to a stop. Reverse power. Dead stop. We'll hold this position and wait for them. Lieutenant, are you recommending we fight a life form that can do all those things? I'd like to hear your advice. Thank you, conn. Commander, signal the following in all languages and on all frequencies. We surrender. State that we are not asking for any terms or conditions. Mid twenty first century. The post-atomic horror. But these courts happened in the past. Can we assume you mean this will be a fair trial? Tasha, no. You've got a lot to learn about humans if you think you can torture us or frighten us into silence. Will she live? Or what? Or this? Her death? Or worse? You promised the prisoners will not be harmed. We plead nothing so long as you break your own rules. I suggest you are now having second thoughts it. You are considering that if you conduct a fair trial, which was your promise, you may lose. Yes, even though you're judge and prosecutor. Accepted, so long as you keep to your agreement. And assaulting prisoners is hardly a fair trial. court of fact! We humans know our past, even when we're ashamed of it. I recognise this court system as the one that agreed with that line from Shakespeare. Which led to the rule guilty until proven innocent. Grievously savage could mean anything. I will answer only specific charges. I see no charges against us, Your Honour. Guilty. Provisionally. We question whether this court is abiding by its own trial instructions. Have I have permission to have Commander Data repeat the record? These will be your own words, your Honour. What exactly what followed his Honour's statement that the prisoner will not be harmed? Alright! We agree there is evidence to support the court's contention that humans have been savage. Therefore I say test us. Test whether this is presently true of humans. There must be many ways we can be tested. We have a long mission ahead of us. We've heard that we may find it rather interesting. Do we have clearance? Make it so. Is the viewer ready? We'll first bring you up to date on a little adventure we had on our way here, Commander. Then we'll talk. Welcome aboard. Inform them we'll connect as soon as they arrive. And sent the Commander to me when he's finished. Come. It seems we're alive only because we have been placed on probation. A very serious kind of probation. Go. Acknowledged. Commander Riker will conduct a manual docking. Picard out. You've reported in, haven't you? You are qualified? Then I mean now, Commander. A fairly routine manoeuvre but you handled it quite well. I do have some questions for you though. I see in your file that Captain DeSoto thinks very highly of you. One curious thing, however, you refused to let him beam down to Altair Three. I see. A Captain's rank means nothing to you. Isn't it just possible that you don't get to be a Starfleet Captain without knowing whether it's safe to beam down or not? Isn't it a little presumptuous of a first officer to second guess his captain's judgment? Always. And you don't intend to back off that position? One further thing. A special favour. Using the same kind of strength you showed with Captain DeSoto, I would appreciate it if you can keep me from making an ass of myself with children. I'm not a family man, Riker, and yet, Starfleet has given me a ship with children aboard. And I don't feel comfortable with children. But, since a captain needs an image of geniality, you're to see that's what I project. Welcome to the Enterprise, Commander Riker. Did you signal the Hood, Commander Riker? What was my answer, computer? Lieutenant! Do you intend to blast a hole through the viewer? If the purpose of this is to test humans, your honour, we must proceed in our own way. But futilely. Of course you will. We've a long voyage ahead of us. We do exactly what we would do if this Q never existed. If we're going to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are. Personal log, stardate 41153.8. Of the twenty four hours Q allotted us to prove ourselves, eleven have now passed without incident. And yet I cannot forget Q's prediction that we will face some critical test. And it's your belief that this is what made it possible for them to construct this base to Starfleet standards? Perhaps it's like those incidents you describe in your report as almost magical attempts to please us. None of it suggests anything threatening. If only every life form had as much desire to please. Ready to beam down? I'm looking forward to meeting this Groppler Zorn. As if it's something Q is doing to trick us? Over here. I've asked the Counsellor to join us in this meeting. May I introduce our new First Officer, Commander William Riker. Commander Riker, this is our ship's Counsellor, Deanna Troi. Have the two of you met before? Excellent. I consider it important for my key officers know each other's abilities. My crew and I need a bit more information before we make our recommendations to Starfleet. Good, since we admire what we've seen of your construction techniques. Starfleet may be interested in your constructing starbases elsewhere also. Counsellor? What is it? Yes. No secrets here if we're to be all to be friends. Agreed, Groppler? The source of this, Groppler. Do you have any idea? And that's it? No other comment? While evading even our simplest questions about it. We'll adjourn for now while we all reconsider our positions. Fine. I hope they find you as tasty as they did their past associates. Very good, Commander. Good idea. Children are not allowed on the Bridge. Doctor Crusher. Your son? Well, as long as he's here. I knew your father, Wesley. Want a look around? But don't touch anything! Try it out. The panel on your right is for log entries, library computer access and retrieval, viewscreen control, intercoms, and so on. Here we have The forward viewscreen is controlled from the ops position there How the hell do you know that, boy? Off the bridge! Both of you. Picard. Go ahead. Have Commander Riker and his team beam back up. Security, could that be the Hood returning here? Put it on main viewer. Identification? Hail it. Raise all shields, phasers at ready. Get me Groppler Zorn. And continue universal greetings on all frequencies. Zorn, an unidentified vessel has entered into orbit with us. Do you know who it is? I asked if you knew who it is. You mentioned the Ferengi Alliance to me. Are you certain? Sensor scans, Mister Worf. Bring photon torpedoes to ready! Tune that down! Commander Riker, come in. Can you hear me? Commander Riker, come in. Where are you? And Farpoint Station? Any damage there? It's from an unidentified vessel that's entered into orbit with us here. No ID, no answer to our signals. Understand, Commander. Would you object to your Captain ordering a clearly illegal kidnapping? Groppler Zorn may have the answers we need. Get him. Bring him here. They're forcing a difficult decision on me, Counsellor. We are in the midst of diplomatic discussions with them. Lieutenant, lock phasers on that vessel. Get off my bridge! We've no idea who is on that vessel. My order was a routine safety precaution. Captain to CMO. Are you reading any of this? Compliments on that, Doctor. Any questions? Starfleet people are trained to render aid and assistance whenever Let's consider your thoughts. You call us savages and yet you knew those people down there would be killed. It is your conduct that is uncivilised. Go to manoeuvring jets. Position us between that vessel and the planet. Force fields full on. From the same source as before? That is enough, damn it! An agreement which you are at this moment breaking by taking over our vessel, interfering with my decisions. Either leave or finish us. Do nothing that he asks. I'll risk none of my crew on that unknown. At least you impressed him, Number One. That's hopeful. I'll attend to my duty. I see nothing so bitter about that. I didn't want you thinking me harsh. Cold blooded. I didn't welcome you aboard personally, professionally. I made you come to me on the Bridge. I yelled at your son. Who, as you pointed out, was quite correct. He does seem to have a very good grasp of starship operations. Ah, but, now, your assignment here. I would consider and approve you a transfer for you. Hardly. Your service record shows you're just the Chief Medical Officer I want. I'm trying to be considerate of your feelings, Doctor. For you to work with a commanding officer who would continually remind you of a terrible personal tragedy. You requested this posting? Ah. Then, welcome aboard, Doctor. I, er, I hope we can be friends? Transporter chief, yank them back now! Riker, acknowledge! Transporter Chief, do you have their coordinates? Transporter Chief! Transporter Chief, come in! I've people in trouble over there, Q. Everyone at ease. That's an order. Q, my people are in trouble. Let me help them, please. I'll do whatever you say. It seems I did make that bargain. No! Do nothing he demands. Was there a reason? If you'd earned that uniform you're wearing, you'd know that the unknown is what brings us out here. Let's test that. Beginning with the tunnels you have under Farpoint, Groppler. In return for some pain you'd given other creature? Thank you. That was the missing part. Lieutenant Yar, rig main phaser banks to deliver an energy beam. And into specific patterns of matter, just as our transporters do. Groppler, you captured something like that, didn't you? Transmit the message, leave Farpoint Space Station immediately. Attacking those who had captured, capture its mate. Lock it in on Farpoint Station. Let it have whatever it can absorb. Energise. Discontinue. Groppler Zorn, there'll soon be no Farpoint Station, if I'm right about this. Which your world furnishes you in plenty. Only enough to keep it alive, so that you could force it to shape itself into whatever form you needed! Why do you use other lifeforms for recreation? Leave us! We've passed your little test. Get off my ship. All stations? Some problem, Riker? Oh no, Number One. I'm sure most will be much more interesting. Let's see what's out there. Engage.</td>\n",

       "0  You will agree, Data, that Starfleet's orders are difficult? As simple as that. It's hardly simple, Data, to negotiate a friendly agreement for Starfleet to use the base while at the same time snoop around finding how and why the life form there built it. Data, how can you be programmed as a virtual encyclopedia of human information without knowing a simple word like snoop? It means to spy, to sneak. Exactly, yes. Shut off that damned noise. Go to Yellow Alert. Reverse power, full stop. That's quite a directive. Would you mind identifying what you are? Data, call medics. He would not have injured you. Do you recognise this, the stun setting? What? That nonsense is centuries behind us. Most certainly I deny it. I agree we still were when humans wore costumes like that, four hundred years ago. But even when we wore costumes like that we'd already started to make rapid progress. Yes you can, Lieutenant Yar. No. The same old story is the one we're meeting now. Self-righteous life forms who are eager not to learn but to prosecute, to judge anything they don't understand or can't tolerate. We've no fear of what the true facts about us will reveal. Sense anything, Commander? From this point, no station aboard, repeat no station, for any reason will make use of transmitted signals or intercom. We'll try and take them by surprise. Let's see what this galaxy class starship can do. Lieutenant, inform engine room to prepare for maximum acceleration. Records search, Data. Results of detaching saucer section at high warp velocity. Search theoretical. Using print-out only, notify all decks to prepare for maximum acceleration. Now hear this, Maximum, you're entitled to know, means that we'll be pushing our engines well beyond safety limits. Our hope is to surprise whatever that is out there, try and outrun it. Our only other option is to tuck tail between our legs and return to Earth as they demand. Stand by. Engage. Steady on that. Continue accelerating. Counsellor, at this point I'm open to guesses about what we've just met. Beyond? Are you sure? Reverse angle. Worf, inform the engine room we need more. Go to yellow alert. Arm aft photon torpedoes. Place them on ready status. Now hear this. Print-out message, urgent, all stations on all decks. Prepare for emergency saucer sever. You will command the saucer section, Lieutenant. You are a Starfleet officer, Lieutenant. Make the mark, Data. Note in ship's log that at this startime, I'm transferring command to the battle bridge. Lieutenant, your torpedoes must detonate close enough to the hostile to blind it at the moment we separate. Worf, this is the Captain. At the moment of separation, we will reverse power just enough to get your saucer section out ahead and clear of us. Begin countdown. Mark. Let's come to a stop. Reverse power. Dead stop. We'll hold this position and wait for them. Lieutenant, are you recommending we fight a life form that can do all those things? I'd like to hear your advice. Thank you, conn. Commander, signal the following in all languages and on all frequencies. We surrender. State that we are not asking for any terms or conditions. Mid twenty first century. The post-atomic horror. But these courts happened in the past. Can we assume you mean this will be a fair trial? Tasha, no. You've got a lot to learn about humans if you think you can torture us or frighten us into silence. Will she live? Or what? Or this? Her death? Or worse? You promised the prisoners will not be harmed. We plead nothing so long as you break your own rules. I suggest you are now having second thoughts it. You are considering that if you conduct a fair trial, which was your promise, you may lose. Yes, even though you're judge and prosecutor. Accepted, so long as you keep to your agreement. And assaulting prisoners is hardly a fair trial. court of fact! We humans know our past, even when we're ashamed of it. I recognise this court system as the one that agreed with that line from Shakespeare. Which led to the rule guilty until proven innocent. Grievously savage could mean anything. I will answer only specific charges. I see no charges against us, Your Honour. Guilty. Provisionally. We question whether this court is abiding by its own trial instructions. Have I have permission to have Commander Data repeat the record? These will be your own words, your Honour. What exactly what followed his Honour's statement that the prisoner will not be harmed? Alright! We agree there is evidence to support the court's contention that humans have been savage. Therefore I say test us. Test whether this is presently true of humans. There must be many ways we can be tested. We have a long mission ahead of us. We've heard that we may find it rather interesting. Do we have clearance? Make it so. Is the viewer ready? We'll first bring you up to date on a little adventure we had on our way here, Commander. Then we'll talk. Welcome aboard. Inform them we'll connect as soon as they arrive. And sent the Commander to me when he's finished. Come. It seems we're alive only because we have been placed on probation. A very serious kind of probation. Go. Acknowledged. Commander Riker will conduct a manual docking. Picard out. You've reported in, haven't you? You are qualified? Then I mean now, Commander. A fairly routine manoeuvre but you handled it quite well. I do have some questions for you though. I see in your file that Captain DeSoto thinks very highly of you. One curious thing, however, you refused to let him beam down to Altair Three. I see. A Captain's rank means nothing to you. Isn't it just possible that you don't get to be a Starfleet Captain without knowing whether it's safe to beam down or not? Isn't it a little presumptuous of a first officer to second guess his captain's judgment? Always. And you don't intend to back off that position? One further thing. A special favour. Using the same kind of strength you showed with Captain DeSoto, I would appreciate it if you can keep me from making an ass of myself with children. I'm not a family man, Riker, and yet, Starfleet has given me a ship with children aboard. And I don't feel comfortable with children. But, since a captain needs an image of geniality, you're to see that's what I project. Welcome to the Enterprise, Commander Riker. Did you signal the Hood, Commander Riker? What was my answer, computer? Lieutenant! Do you intend to blast a hole through the viewer? If the purpose of this is to test humans, your honour, we must proceed in our own way. But futilely. Of course you will. We've a long voyage ahead of us. We do exactly what we would do if this Q never existed. If we're going to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are. Personal log, stardate 41153.8. Of the twenty four hours Q allotted us to prove ourselves, eleven have now passed without incident. And yet I cannot forget Q's prediction that we will face some critical test. And it's your belief that this is what made it possible for them to construct this base to Starfleet standards? Perhaps it's like those incidents you describe in your report as almost magical attempts to please us. None of it suggests anything threatening. If only every life form had as much desire to please. Ready to beam down? I'm looking forward to meeting this Groppler Zorn. As if it's something Q is doing to trick us? Over here. I've asked the Counsellor to join us in this meeting. May I introduce our new First Officer, Commander William Riker. Commander Riker, this is our ship's Counsellor, Deanna Troi. Have the two of you met before? Excellent. I consider it important for my key officers know each other's abilities. My crew and I need a bit more information before we make our recommendations to Starfleet. Good, since we admire what we've seen of your construction techniques. Starfleet may be interested in your constructing starbases elsewhere also. Counsellor? What is it? Yes. No secrets here if we're to be all to be friends. Agreed, Groppler? The source of this, Groppler. Do you have any idea? And that's it? No other comment? While evading even our simplest questions about it. We'll adjourn for now while we all reconsider our positions. Fine. I hope they find you as tasty as they did their past associates. Very good, Commander. Good idea. Children are not allowed on the Bridge. Doctor Crusher. Your son? Well, as long as he's here. I knew your father, Wesley. Want a look around? But don't touch anything! Try it out. The panel on your right is for log entries, library computer access and retrieval, viewscreen control, intercoms, and so on. Here we have The forward viewscreen is controlled from the ops position there How the hell do you know that, boy? Off the bridge! Both of you. Picard. Go ahead. Have Commander Riker and his team beam back up. Security, could that be the Hood returning here? Put it on main viewer. Identification? Hail it. Raise all shields, phasers at ready. Get me Groppler Zorn. And continue universal greetings on all frequencies. Zorn, an unidentified vessel has entered into orbit with us. Do you know who it is? I asked if you knew who it is. You mentioned the Ferengi Alliance to me. Are you certain? Sensor scans, Mister Worf. Bring photon torpedoes to ready! Tune that down! Commander Riker, come in. Can you hear me? Commander Riker, come in. Where are you? And Farpoint Station? Any damage there? It's from an unidentified vessel that's entered into orbit with us here. No ID, no answer to our signals. Understand, Commander. Would you object to your Captain ordering a clearly illegal kidnapping? Groppler Zorn may have the answers we need. Get him. Bring him here. They're forcing a difficult decision on me, Counsellor. We are in the midst of diplomatic discussions with them. Lieutenant, lock phasers on that vessel. Get off my bridge! We've no idea who is on that vessel. My order was a routine safety precaution. Captain to CMO. Are you reading any of this? Compliments on that, Doctor. Any questions? Starfleet people are trained to render aid and assistance whenever Let's consider your thoughts. You call us savages and yet you knew those people down there would be killed. It is your conduct that is uncivilised. Go to manoeuvring jets. Position us between that vessel and the planet. Force fields full on. From the same source as before? That is enough, damn it! An agreement which you are at this moment breaking by taking over our vessel, interfering with my decisions. Either leave or finish us. Do nothing that he asks. I'll risk none of my crew on that unknown. At least you impressed him, Number One. That's hopeful. I'll attend to my duty. I see nothing so bitter about that. I didn't want you thinking me harsh. Cold blooded. I didn't welcome you aboard personally, professionally. I made you come to me on the Bridge. I yelled at your son. Who, as you pointed out, was quite correct. He does seem to have a very good grasp of starship operations. Ah, but, now, your assignment here. I would consider and approve you a transfer for you. Hardly. Your service record shows you're just the Chief Medical Officer I want. I'm trying to be considerate of your feelings, Doctor. For you to work with a commanding officer who would continually remind you of a terrible personal tragedy. You requested this posting? Ah. Then, welcome aboard, Doctor. I, er, I hope we can be friends? Transporter chief, yank them back now! Riker, acknowledge! Transporter Chief, do you have their coordinates? Transporter Chief! Transporter Chief, come in! I've people in trouble over there, Q. Everyone at ease. That's an order. Q, my people are in trouble. Let me help them, please. I'll do whatever you say. It seems I did make that bargain. No! Do nothing he demands. Was there a reason? If you'd earned that uniform you're wearing, you'd know that the unknown is what brings us out here. Let's test that. Beginning with the tunnels you have under Farpoint, Groppler. In return for some pain you'd given other creature? Thank you. That was the missing part. Lieutenant Yar, rig main phaser banks to deliver an energy beam. And into specific patterns of matter, just as our transporters do. Groppler, you captured something like that, didn't you? Transmit the message, leave Farpoint Space Station immediately. Attacking those who had captured, capture its mate. Lock it in on Farpoint Station. Let it have whatever it can absorb. Energise. Discontinue. Groppler Zorn, there'll soon be no Farpoint Station, if I'm right about this. Which your world furnishes you in plenty. Only enough to keep it alive, so that you could force it to shape itself into whatever form you needed! Why do you use other lifeforms for recreation? Leave us! We've passed your little test. Get off my ship. All stations? Some problem, Riker? Oh no, Number One. I'm sure most will be much more interesting. Let's see what's out there. Engage.   \n",

       "      <td>You will agree, Data, that Starfleet's orders are difficult? As simple as that. It's hardly simple, Data, to negotiate a friendly agreement for Starfleet to use the base while at the same time snoop around finding how and why the life form there built it. Data, how can you be programmed as a virtual encyclopedia of human information without knowing a simple word like snoop? It means to spy, to sneak. Exactly, yes. Shut off that damned noise. Go to Yellow Alert. Reverse power, full stop. That's quite a directive. Would you mind identifying what you are? Data, call medics. He would not have injured you. Do you recognise this, the stun setting? What? That nonsense is centuries behind us. Most certainly I deny it. I agree we still were when humans wore costumes like that, four hundred years ago. But even when we wore costumes like that we'd already started to make rapid progress. Yes you can, Lieutenant Yar. No. The same old story is the one we're meeting now. Self-righteous life forms who are eager not to learn but to prosecute, to judge anything they don't understand or can't tolerate. We've no fear of what the true facts about us will reveal. Sense anything, Commander? From this point, no station aboard, repeat no station, for any reason will make use of transmitted signals or intercom. We'll try and take them by surprise. Let's see what this galaxy class starship can do. Lieutenant, inform engine room to prepare for maximum acceleration. Records search, Data. Results of detaching saucer section at high warp velocity. Search theoretical. Using print-out only, notify all decks to prepare for maximum acceleration. Now hear this, Maximum, you're entitled to know, means that we'll be pushing our engines well beyond safety limits. Our hope is to surprise whatever that is out there, try and outrun it. Our only other option is to tuck tail between our legs and return to Earth as they demand. Stand by. Engage. Steady on that. Continue accelerating. Counsellor, at this point I'm open to guesses about what we've just met. Beyond? Are you sure? Reverse angle. Worf, inform the engine room we need more. Go to yellow alert. Arm aft photon torpedoes. Place them on ready status. Now hear this. Print-out message, urgent, all stations on all decks. Prepare for emergency saucer sever. You will command the saucer section, Lieutenant. You are a Starfleet officer, Lieutenant. Make the mark, Data. Note in ship's log that at this startime, I'm transferring command to the battle bridge. Lieutenant, your torpedoes must detonate close enough to the hostile to blind it at the moment we separate. Worf, this is the Captain. At the moment of separation, we will reverse power just enough to get your saucer section out ahead and clear of us. Begin countdown. Mark. Let's come to a stop. Reverse power. Dead stop. We'll hold this position and wait for them. Lieutenant, are you recommending we fight a life form that can do all those things? I'd like to hear your advice. Thank you, conn. Commander, signal the following in all languages and on all frequencies. We surrender. State that we are not asking for any terms or conditions. Mid twenty first century. The post-atomic horror. But these courts happened in the past. Can we assume you mean this will be a fair trial? Tasha, no. You've got a lot to learn about humans if you think you can torture us or frighten us into silence. Will she live? Or what? Or this? Her death? Or worse? You promised the prisoners will not be harmed. We plead nothing so long as you break your own rules. I suggest you are now having second thoughts it. You are considering that if you conduct a fair trial, which was your promise, you may lose. Yes, even though you're judge and prosecutor. Accepted, so long as you keep to your agreement. And assaulting prisoners is hardly a fair trial. court of fact! We humans know our past, even when we're ashamed of it. I recognise this court system as the one that agreed with that line from Shakespeare. Which led to the rule guilty until proven innocent. Grievously savage could mean anything. I will answer only specific charges. I see no charges against us, Your Honour. Guilty. Provisionally. We question whether this court is abiding by its own trial instructions. Have I have permission to have Commander Data repeat the record? These will be your own words, your Honour. What exactly what followed his Honour's statement that the prisoner will not be harmed? Alright! We agree there is evidence to support the court's contention that humans have been savage. Therefore I say test us. Test whether this is presently true of humans. There must be many ways we can be tested. We have a long mission ahead of us. We've heard that we may find it rather interesting. Do we have clearance? Make it so. Is the viewer ready? We'll first bring you up to date on a little adventure we had on our way here, Commander. Then we'll talk. Welcome aboard. Inform them we'll connect as soon as they arrive. And sent the Commander to me when he's finished. Come. It seems we're alive only because we have been placed on probation. A very serious kind of probation. Go. Acknowledged. Commander Riker will conduct a manual docking. Picard out. You've reported in, haven't you? You are qualified? Then I mean now, Commander. A fairly routine manoeuvre but you handled it quite well. I do have some questions for you though. I see in your file that Captain DeSoto thinks very highly of you. One curious thing, however, you refused to let him beam down to Altair Three. I see. A Captain's rank means nothing to you. Isn't it just possible that you don't get to be a Starfleet Captain without knowing whether it's safe to beam down or not? Isn't it a little presumptuous of a first officer to second guess his captain's judgment? Always. And you don't intend to back off that position? One further thing. A special favour. Using the same kind of strength you showed with Captain DeSoto, I would appreciate it if you can keep me from making an ass of myself with children. I'm not a family man, Riker, and yet, Starfleet has given me a ship with children aboard. And I don't feel comfortable with children. But, since a captain needs an image of geniality, you're to see that's what I project. Welcome to the Enterprise, Commander Riker. Did you signal the Hood, Commander Riker? What was my answer, computer? Lieutenant! Do you intend to blast a hole through the viewer? If the purpose of this is to test humans, your honour, we must proceed in our own way. But futilely. Of course you will. We've a long voyage ahead of us. We do exactly what we would do if this Q never existed. If we're going to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are. Personal log, stardate 41153.8. Of the twenty four hours Q allotted us to prove ourselves, eleven have now passed without incident. And yet I cannot forget Q's prediction that we will face some critical test. And it's your belief that this is what made it possible for them to construct this base to Starfleet standards?

       "      <td>On our way. You have the helm, Mister Data. Cargo One. This should be an interesting experience. It's their way, Lieutenant. Do they have our coordinates? This is Captain Picard aboard the Starfleet vessel Enterprise. Please do us the honour of visiting our vessel. Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Welcome aboard. These are my officers. My second in command, Commander William Riker. Ship's Counsellor, Deanna Troi. And my Security Officer, Lieutenant Natasha Yar. Yes, Lutan, that is her expertise. Lutan, we are aware of many of your planet's achievements, and its unique similarity to an ancient Earth culture we all admire. On behalf of the Federation, therefore, I would like to present this token of our gratitude and friendship. From China's Sung Dynasty, Fourteenth Century. Ah, yes, indeed. If you require respect from us, I am sure that you will see it. If there is something else, any further courtesy? And used for many other things too. Commander Riker, perhaps you and Counsellor Troi will demonstrate. Very well. Understanding has made friends of many different people. We've had a good beginning, Lutan. Picard to Bridge. Red alert. What comm. contact have we had with them? Make contact there and on all hailing frequencies. This is the Enterprise to Lutan and the Ligonian government. You have committed an unfriendly act. We insist that you reply immediately. Set them for a display blast a thousand metres short of the planet's surface. Fire. This is Captain Picard of the Enterprise with a message to Lutan, whom I have so far acknowledged as a friend. But you have now committed what our laws regard as an attack upon us. Since you have visited our vessel, you most certainly know the power of it. We insist that you reply to this message. Opinion, Counsellor. Will they injure Lieutenant Yar? Other comments? Yes, Doctor? You were testing if you can replicate the vaccine. I'm aware of that, Doctor. That's true. But I have seen my share of death. Perhaps the good ones never get them. What? Oh, yes. Alright. Well, yes, speaking as a mother. Wesley? No. Why don't you sit at Ops next to Lieutenant La Forge. Is the whole ship deaf?! Sit down over there, young man. Temporarily. Excuse me. Doctor Crusher, some of this may interest you. Lets hear the analysis. Mister Data, the French language for centuries on Earth represented civilisation. Well, Lutan, what do you want? What is required is an image of Lieutenant Yar, well and Ask for her? And now, Lutan, you have boldly taken Lieutenant Yar from us, and we ask that you now please return her. Lutan is a fortunate man. You've met Counsellor Troi. Then, sir, the courtesy of seeing Lieutenant Yar. I'd like to see her now. Such as the politeness of saying please before abducting someone? Yours is a different world. Have you been treated well, Lieutenant? My ship's company and I are certain of your gentle wisdom in that. Something to be carefully avoided. I agree. Until tonight, Lutan. Lutan, you have granted us hospitality and the safety of your Centreplace]. The gifts you give us are rare and precious. We thank you. And now, according with the customs of your ancestors, whom we honour and respect, I am here in peace to ask for the return of Lieutenant Yar. You speak of a code of honour, but what you are saying now, according to our customs, is called an act of war. No! The challenge is unequivocally refused! Did you have any idea, Lieutenant, that Lutan was suddenly going to announce that he wanted you for his First One? Tell me what you know about this? We're all being manipulated, Lieutenant, myself most of all. That thought had passed through my mind, Counsellor. If anything, even worse than we'd heard. You have nothing to prove anything here, Lieutenant. Counsellor, you're the last person I'd expect to argue in favour of accepting the challenge. The odds are. I want some explanations from Lutan. It's a great pity you began by abducting my Security Officer, Lutan, because I should tell you I do admire the hospitality you offer here. Some of it I do understand. She is a rather lovely female. Nothing. Well, almost nothing in my position of ship's Captain. But it puzzles me. If you feel that way for Tasha, why have you challenged her to a fight to the death? Ah, but you are also a man of great importance and wealth. Ah, I see. You, too, understand the proper value of women. You are a truly clever person, Lutan. You stand to lose nothing, either way the challenge goes. I will order Lieutenant Yar to fight. And may your cloak bring you all you deserve. Lock in on this location. Energise. You've both seen the message about the plague? We need to know as much as possible about Ligonian armaments. Data, especially important is an analysis of their combat capabilities. Geordi, concentrate on their cutting edges, wherever applicable, durability, composition, weaknesses of material. From the perspective of Lieutenant Yar using them in combat with Lutan's wife. And that won't be known until combat begins. You're right, Data. It does sound like a joke. With the power of the Enterprise, we could overwhelm this place easily, just take what we want. Which means, of course That is, ironically, what this is about. By our standards, the customs here, their code of honour, is the same kind of pompous, strutting charades that endangered our own species a few centuries ago. We evolved out of it because no one else imposed their own. I'm sorry, this is becoming a speech. Not entitled to ramble on about something everyone knows. Carry on. Then help me, please. What is a way out of this? Poison? What about those lengths of metal in the yard outside? Thank you, Data. Go ahead, Riker. We're alone. Thank you, Number One. Lieutenant, do you still feel that you want to go through with this challenge? Do you judge your condition good? Stay alive. We'll hope to do the rest. Exactly what do you find unfair, Lutan? They fought to the death. You saw the final blow. You know the effects of your poison. I certainly won't stop her, if she cares to claim that honour. Picard here. No problem, Number One. Send down a medical team. Five to beam up. Energise. This way, gentlemen. The challenge was carried out. She died, Lutan. Lutan, we can provide you with records of her death and how Doctor Crusher brought her back. What? Wesley. Well, thanks again for manning one of our bridge stations, Wesley. We'll see that you have another chance. So what's the delay, Number One? Why aren't we warping out of here?</td>\n",

       "      <td>I don't understand your concern, Number One. They're not authorised to make any alterations in our engines, and according to Starfleet's report, they will simply test different ways of entering warp speed and different intermix formulas. What's the harm in that? Gibberish? Then how do you explain Starfleet's report that the same tests on the USS Ajax and on the Fearless over there, resulted in a measurable increase in propulsion. Stand by for Commander Riker, Chief. He's on his way. Since you're concerned about these tests. Very good. Engineering, this is the Bridge. It's your call. Affirmative, Number One. Are you ready? La Forge, set in warp one point five. Engage. What is our velocity? Reverse engines. Because no one has gone this fast. Reverse engines. All stop. Position? Position, Mister La Forge. That's not possible. Data, what distance have we travelled? I can't accept that. Mister Data! Just explain what brought us here. What is he saying, Number One? Considering where we are, we must assume it isn't. Thrill? Yes, but isn't the real point, can you do it again? Can you get us home? Commander Riker will join you in a moment. Comment is invited. Counsellor? Spoken like a true Starfleet graduate. It is tempting, eh, Number One? I know that if Kosinski can get us home, Starfleet can use his technique to bring back a pure science vessel to do even more. Number One, tell Kosinski prepare to get us out of here. Standing by, Number One. As before Begin at warp one point five. All stop. Yes, but where is this place? Data, you have the helm. I'll be in Engineering. What's wrong? Ensign, what are you doing? Maman? This can't be. You've been Yes, I've felt that. But why now, suddenly. We believe it the outer rim. Maman, do you understand these things? Can you tell me where my ship is? What is this place? Just a moment, Number One! No. No, let's help all of us. General quarters. Red Alert. I had to get everyone's attention. It was the quickest way. This is the Captain. This is not a drill. It seems that in this place, the world of the physical universe and the world of ideas is somehow intermixed. What we think Also becomes a reality. We must, therefore, I repeat, must begin controlling our thoughts. We will give you more on this as our understanding increases. The Enterprise will stay at full alert until the crisis is over. What did you do? What are you talking about? How could you? How could any of us? If you knew something, why didn't you say so? He's unconscious. Why? What does that mean? He mustn't. He's the only one who can get us back. Cause? What is the boy doing here? He knows. We all know. Will he live? Wake him. We don't have that luxury. Wake him. Doctor. Wes. We all have other friends aboard this ship, too. If we stay here much longer we may lose the ability to distinguish between thought and reality. Now, regardless of the risk, wake him. Now. Do you recognise me? I'm the Captain and I need answers. Who are you? Or what? Traveller? What is your destination? Yes, what place are you trying to reach? Then what is the purpose of your journey? That's not an answer. Until now. Our reality? And in order to satisfy this curiosity, you have brought my ship and my crew into great risk. Some mistakes? What mistakes could possibly explain these incredible explosions of velocity? I believe there may be a warp speed that can get us beyond Galaxy M Thirty Three, but there is no velocity of any magnitude that can possibly bring us wherever this is. Is it true what our navigation sensors are telling us? Are we millions of light years away from where we were? Well, what got us here? Thought? No. No, it actually makes sense to me. Only the power of thought could explain what has been happening. Especially out here. Chaos. What we think is what happens. What's happening? Revive him. Unless he was distracted by something. Do you have any facts that fit this? Can you get us back? And we report our observations how? To whom? Can you get us back? Number One, take him down to main Engineering. I'll be on the Bridge. Strange how he seems to care for you. The boy? I must get my ship back. Do we have time for this? Encourage him in what? Somewhat. We're going to get back home. Take him to Engineering. I'll be on the Bridge. Put it out! Think! Put the flame out in your thoughts. Now, Get to your station and concentrate on your assignment. Do you have any further advice, Counsellor? All decks, all stations. This is the Captain speaking. All decks, I must have your full attention. In a few moments, as we attempt to warp back home, it is vital, absolutely vital, that you centre your thoughts on your duty or on the welfare of the one called the Traveller. Think of giving him some of your strength. Now, this is an order. You must try to do this. And now, attempt to concentrate completely on your duty of the moment. Or on the Traveller, on his well being. Think of him as someone you care deeply about. All decks, all stations. Battle stations. Helm, set in warp one point five, retroactive course. Bridge to Engineering. Stand by. On my order, Mister Data, Mister La Forge. Engage. It's not happening. It's not enough. Cease Red Alert. Gone? Attention all decks. This is to inform you that with your support the Traveller has returned us to our galaxy. However, he has now left us. Wherever he has gone, we wish him well. Have the boy sent to the Bridge, Number One. Our next assignment is on this heading? Mister Data, Mister La Forge, increase to warp five. Same heading. Ah, Wesley. Come on the Bridge. Move! Commander Riker has told me how supportive you were in Engineering. Well done. At ease. Sit here in Command. Oh, that's true. Well, I can't waive them again. Only commissioned officers. Please don't interrupt me, Wesley. Any commissioned rank? Even ensign? Well, then, I'll have to make him an acting ensign. Captain's log, stardate 41263.4.

When my ship's Doctor investigated it, she discovered what you had done. There never was a ransom. All he was ever interested in was vengeance. He's not a DaiMon. He was stripped of command. He lied to you so that you would help him in his plan. The Enterprise is closing in on your position. If you let the two of us go, they won't attack you. They will cripple your vessel and keep you here until the Ferengi authorities arrive. You've got a lot deal of explaining to do. Your only hope is to turn Bok over to them and tell them that he deceived you. I'm glad to hear it. Are you sure that you wouldn't like to stay on board the Enterprise for a few more days? I understand. I will. I put a little something into your bag while you were packing. I know you'd probably have preferred a bottle of Saurian brandy, but that's all I could come up with.

       "      <td>Counsellor! What's today's date? The date! 47988. I'm not sure. I don't know how or why, but I'm moving back and forth through time. I had this feeling I had physically left the Enterprise. I was in another time, another place. I was somewhere in the past. You see, it's all slipping away so fast. It's like waking up from a nightmare. It was years ago. It was before I took command of the Enterprise. I was talking to someone, I can't remember who. And then it all changed. I was no longer in the past. I was now an old man in the future, and I was outside and I was doing something. I can't remember what it was. I'm sorry, it's all gone. I just can't remember. No, no, it was much more than a dream. The smells, the sounds, the very touch of things, much more real than a dream. You see, I can't say. At first I had a sense of confusion, disorientation. I wasn't sure where I was. And then all that passed and it all seemed perfectly natural, as though I belonged in that time. But I can't Geordi. Oh, I haven't been called that for some time either. How about Jean-Luc? Good Lord, Geordi. Well, how long has it been? No, no, no. Since you last called me Captain, since we were all together on the Enterprise? Twenty five years. Well, time has been good to you. Oh, well, I'm just tying up some vines. How is Leah? What about the little ones, Brett, Alandra and er? Sidney. So what brings you here? Geordi, you don't make the trip from Rigel Three to Earth just to drop by. So, you've heard? I'm not an invalid. Irumodic Syndrome can take years to run its course. Well now that you're here, you can help me carry those tools. Well, my cooking may not be up to Leah's standards, but I can still make a decent cup of tea. Oh, I read your last novel. I thought that the protagonist a little too flamboyant, but for the rest I I'm sorry, Lieutenant. My mind must have wandered. What were you saying? No. Of course, I'm familiar with the blueprints and specifications, but this will be my first time aboard. I'm sure she is. No. It's just that you look very familiar. Tasha. I was just with Tasha in the shuttle. Actually, I really like running around the ship in my bare feet. A defect that you hadn't noticed before? If that's so, why do you look like you've just signed my death sentence? I wouldn't worry about it. Something tells me that you're going to have to put up with me for a long time to come. Has Worf found anything? I wasn't dreaming. Something happened. Go ahead, Mister Worf. Beverly? Mister Worf, will you route the call through to Doctor Crusher's office. Admiral. Is there any explanation why they would make such a blatantly aggressive move? What are our orders? Am I authorised to enter the Neutral Zone? Understood. This is not my time. I don't belong here. I was somewhere else a few moments ago. No, no, no! I was somewhere else. I was, it was a long time ago. There was someone talking. I was talking to someone. Beverly. I was talking to Beverly. I'm not senile, you know. This did happen. I was here, I was talking to you, and then I was somewhere else. I was on the Enterprise. I was back on the Enterprise. At least, I think that's where it was. I was in Sickbay. Well, it might have been a hospital. Yes, yes, I know what you're thinking. It's the Irumodic Syndrome. He's beginning to lose his mind, the old man. Well, it's not that. And I'm not daydreaming either. Data. I want to see Data. Because I think he can help. I don't know! I don't know! I want to see Data! Yes, I think he is. You see them, don't you? They're everywhere. They're laughing at me. Why are they laughing? Yes, Data. We'll go see Data. I know how it sounds but it happened. It was real. I was there, back on board the Enterprise. Tea? Earl Grey. Hot. Nothing. Well, Data, I must say, this is a fine place you have here. They certainly treat professors pretty well at Cambridge You say this is Earl Grey? I'd swear that it was Darjeeling. A week. They've prescribed peridaxon. Yes, I know, it's not a cure, There's nothing that can prevent the deterioration of the synaptic pathways. You think that I'm senile, that all this is just a delusion. That's the Data that I remember. I knew I could count on you. To Captain Jean-Luc Picard, stardate 41148 You are hereby requested and required to take command to take command of the USS Enterprise as of this date. Signed Rear Admiral Norah Satie, Starfleet Command. Red Alert! All crew to battle stations. Report. Noted. Counsellor, do you sense anything unusual on board the Enterprise? Perhaps an alien presence that doesn't belong here, maybe one operating on a level of intelligence far superior to our own? Mister Worf, initiate a level two security alert on all decks until further notice. No, of course not. Lieutenant, security alert two. We're on our way, Chief. This tells me that a large spatial anomaly has appeared in the Neutral Zone, in the Devron System. No, we'll proceed to Farpoint. You heard me. Mister Worf, will you man your station. I've no intention of explaining to anyone. We will proceed with our mission to Farpoint as planned. Chief O'Brien, am I right in thinking that you're having a problem with the warp plasma inducers. Well I know how to get them back online. You're with me. We'll be in main Engineering. Mister O'Brien, will you use these specifications to bypass the secondary plasma inducer. But the Chief Engineer isn't on board. Mister O'Brien, trust me. I know you can do it. All those years you spent as a child building those model starship engines. They were well worth it. From your Starfleet records. Commander Data, welcome on board. It's so very good to see you. I could use your help with the infuser array. As you can see, we're having difficulty with the plasma conduits. It happened again. Yes. It's still a little vague, but I can remember more this time. It seems that every time I shift periods, I can retain more memory. At first, it appeared that I was in the future, years from now, and then I was in the past just before our first mission. Counsellor, do you remember when I first came on board the Enterprise? What happened after the welcoming ceremony? Do you have any memory of my calling Red Alert in Spacedock? Do you remember Starfleet diverting us from Farpoint to the Neutral Zone to investigate a spatial anomaly? For all I know, I may find the same thing in the future. These are all very important questions, and perhaps I will find answers to them in the past, but now we have a potentially dangerous threat from the Romulans. I want all departments to present a battle readiness report to me at oh eight hundred hours tomorrow morning. Dismissed. I want continuous subspace sweeps. We may be able to detect a temporal disturbance. Will, this time shifting. When it happens I experience a momentary disorientation. If that should happen during a crisis, I want you to take command immediately. Number One? Speaking of disorientation, are you all right? You have the Bridge, Number One. I'll be in my Ready room. Come. What's this? Beverly. Yes, sir. What? Hey, Beverly? But you said yourself that this is only a possibility. I prefer to look on the future as something which is not written in stone. A lot of things can happen in twenty five years. Yes. What is it? Have we reached the Neutral Zone? Sorry. I was in the past again. What's going on? No, no, no. No, we have to get to the Neutral Zone. In the other two time periods, Starfleet reported a sort of a spatial anomaly in, in, in the Devron system. In Devron system in the Neutral Zone. If the anomaly appeared there in the past, then it might be here too and we have to find out. But if it is here, then it means something. Damn it, Geordi, I know what we have to do! Right. Right. Klingons. In this time period, the Klingons have taken over the Romulan Empire. I know that. I haven't completely lost my mind, you know. Right. Now, I think it's time to call in some old favours. Contact Admiral Riker, Starbase two four seven. Will, if this spatial anomaly really is in the Devron System. Well I don't believe it! What if their long range scanners are faulty? We have to go there and see for ourselves. Will, that is just not good enough. Damn him, anyway. After all we've been through together. He's been sitting behind that desk too long. Medical ship? Yes. Yes! I think I can arrange that. Data, find the USS Pasteur. I have some pull with the Captain. At least, I used to have. Let's just choose one. So, did you get my message? Oh. So that's why you married me. Yes, that's it. Worf. Yes, that's the answer. Worf will help us. So, you kept the name. No, I'm fine. I don't need rest. Look, you are treating me as if I am an invalid. I do have a few years left in me yet. I do not want to be led around, and I do not want to be patronised. Now, I'll go and get some rest. We'll find the anomaly. I know we will. Report. Is there anything unusual in the vicinity, Mister Data? There should be a barrier of some sort nearby. A large plasma field, highly disruptive. This is the right time, the right place. He should be here now. Q! We're here! This has gone on long enough! Counsellor, do you sense an alien presence? I don't understand. This is not the way it's supposed to happen. Maintain this position. I'll be in my Ready room. Q. I knew it. What's going on? The last time that I stood here was seven years ago. You accused me of being the representative of a barbarous species. We demonstrated to you that mankind had become peaceful and benevolent. You agreed and you let us go on our way. Now why am I standing here again? Are you putting mankind on trial again? Is there any connection between the trial seven years ago and whatever's going on now? The spatial anomaly in the Neutral Zone, is it related to what's happening? Is it part of a Romulan plot, a ploy to start a war? That's only four. Did you create the anomaly? Are you responsible for my shifting through time? Why? Guilty of what? We've journeyed to countless new worlds, we've contacted new species, we have expanded our understanding of the universe. We are what we are, and we're doing the best we can. It is not for you to set the standards by which we should be judged. You're going to deny us travel through space? Q, I do not believe that even you are capable of such an act. Me? What sort of meaningless doubletalk is this? Commander, assemble the senior staff and go to Red alert. We have a bigger problem than I thought. Normally I would agree with you, but this time I feel that somehow it is different. There was a deadly earnestness about him. I think he's serious. Which means that in some fashion, I am going to be the cause of the destruction of humanity. So what am I going to do? Lock myself in a room in all three different time periods? Agreed. I've been thinking about my conversation with Q. He admitted that he was responsible for my shifting through time. Now it occurred to me that he might be giving me a chance somehow to save humanity. Well, he's always had a certain fascination with humanity, with myself in particular. I think he has more than a passing interest in what happens to me. If I weren't travelling through time I would never have realized that the anomaly in the Neutral Zone appeared there in the past as well. Assuming that's an important piece of a larger puzzle, my ability to shift through time may be the key to understanding what's going on. Go ahead. We're on our way. All stop. Initiate long range scans. We are. Mister Worf, hail the Romulan flagship. On screen. But surely, Worf, you must still have some influence. We have to get into the Neutral Zone. Can't you just get us permission to cross the border? I don't care what kind of ship we go in. We have to get to the Devron System. I know that I'm an old man and I'm out of touch, but the Worf that I remember was more concerned with things like honour and loyalty than rules and regulations. But that was a long time ago. Maybe you're not the Worf once I knew. Because it always works, Worf. Your problem is that you really do have a sense of honour and you really do care about trust and loyalty. Don't blame me for knowing you so well. Terms accepted. Engage. Set a course for the Devron system, and engage at warp nine. I'm aware of that, Lieutenant. Carry out my orders, Chief. Yes of course, Counsellor. Contact Farpoint Station. I wish to speak with Commander Riker. They don't trust me. They think that I'm behaving erratically. I understand, but I also know what this crew is capable of, even if they don't. I know it's difficult operating in the dark, but right now I don't think I have any other choice. Excuse me. Put him through here. Commander Riker. I wanted to inform you that we'll be delayed in picking you up at Farpoint Station. I can't say. I'll keep you updated.

I appreciate your telling me, but I'm quite sure that the two of you will find some way to deal with the situation. Tea, Earl Grey, hot. There is an alternative, Tomolak. We each know why we're here. We could each send one ship into the Neutral Zone to investigate the anomaly in the Devron System. No. There is no need to make threats. We each know the consequences. Helm, set course for the Devron system, warp five. Engage. All stop. On screen. Full scan, Mister Data. We have to get as much information as possible about that anomaly. All stop. On screen. Then it is larger in the past. Nothing. Full scan, Mister Data. On screen! On screen! Let's see it! I don't understand. It was here in the other two time periods. Why isn't it here now? You're not thinking about leaving? There should be! There has to be! Data, is there some other way to scan for a temporal disturbance? Something that isn't covered in a normal sensor sweep. That's it. Make it so. But six more hours may not be enough. We have to stay here until we find it, no matter how long it takes. Beverly, I cannot believe that you are not willing to stay here until we Damn it, I was just trying to. Look, there are larger concerns here. What you don't understand is that You're right. I was out of line. It won't happen again. But what you have to understand is what is at stake here. Q has said that all of humanity will be destroyed. What? Q? What is going on here? Where is the anomaly? Answer me. What help? My time shifting. The answer does lie there, doesn't it. Now, tell me one thing. This anomaly we're looking for, will that destroy humanity? By doing what? When? How can Report, Mister Data. What is the source of this energy? What if we modified the main deflector to emit an inverse tachyon pulse. That might be able to scan beyond the subspace barrier. That might give us some idea of what the interior of this thing looks like. I have some friends who are quite well versed in it. Make it so. How is this possible? Anti-time? So if time and anti-time were to collide Data, what could have caused this collision of time and anti-time? I believe that if you modify the deflectors to send out an inverse tachyon pulse, then you'll find that the anomaly is a rupture between time and anti-time. I don't have time to discuss it now, Mister Data. Do the modifications and send out the pulse. Then try working on a theory as to what caused this rupture. Mister O'Brien, how large is this anomaly? I don't understand why it's bigger in the past. Lieutenant, you have the Bridge. I'll be in my Ready room. What's going on? Weapons status? We have to stop it! We don't have time for this.

So the anomaly is here too, at Earth. The further back in time, the larger the anomaly. Are you saying that I caused the anomaly, and that the anomaly somehow disrupted the beginnings of life on Earth? Let's concentrate on how this anomaly was initially formed. Speculation? Is there any way that we can scan the interior? Do you know what could? Data do we have a tomographic imaging scanner on board? Can you use it to scan the interior of the anomaly? What is it? Three pulses, from three time periods, converging at one point in space. Computer, where is Admiral Riker? Ensign. How do I get to Ten Forward? Thank you. Will! Will, I know why it's happening. I know what's causing the anomaly. We have to go back. Damn it Will, I know why it's happening. We caused the anomaly with the tachyon pulse. It happened three times, Will. We did it in three different time periods! Will you leave me alone? Damn it, I'm not stupid. Will, the tachyon pulses, they were used in the same spot in three different time periods. Don't you see? When the tachyon pulse used. I mean, I mean when the Pasteur used the tachyon pulse, then, then, we I mean everything started, Will. We set everything in motion. It's like the chicken and the egg, Will, the chicken and the egg! We think it started in the past but it didn't. It started right here, in the future. That's why it's getting larger in the past. Yes! Right. That's it. Yes. That's why it gets larger in the past. It grows as it travels backwards in time. Go back, Will. We go back to the Devron System. I was right. We must stop it here so it can't travel back through time. The next time I'm there, it's the first thing I'll do. Data, disengage the tachyon pulse. Do it. The convergence of the tachyon pulses from the three time periods is what is causing the anomaly. Is there any change in the anomaly? Disengage the tachyon pulse. I know that. But it is imperative that you disengage the tachyon pulse immediately. Why isn't the anomaly being affected? I've shut off the tachyon pulses in the other time periods but it hasn't changed the anomaly. That could be a problem. The anomaly's so much larger in the other two time periods It may be dangerous to take the ship in. Into the anomaly, Chief. Lay in a course for the exact centre and transfer all available power to the shields. No, Lieutenant, I cannot. I understand your concerns, Lieutenant, and I know if I were in your position I would be doing the same thing. Looking for answers. But you're not going to find any because I don't have any to give you. I know it is difficult for you to understand, but we have to take the ship into the very centre of the phenomenon and create a static warp shell. Now, this will put the ship at risk. Quite frankly, we may not survive. But I want you to believe that I am doing this for a greater purpose, and that what is at stake here is more than any of you can possibly imagine. I know you have your doubts about me, about each other, about the ship. All I can say is that although we have only been together for a short time, I know that you are the finest crew in the fleet and I would trust each of you with my life. So, I am asking you for a leap of faith, and to trust me. Take us in, Chief. A static warp shell. It could repair the barrier and collapse the anomaly. Mister Data, you're a clever man in any time period. Helm, lay in a course for the centre of the anomaly and prepare to initiate a static warp shell. The other two Enterprises, they're on their way. All hands, brace for impact! Maintain course and speed. Mister Data, how long until we reach the centre? Initiate warp shell! No, we have to maintain the static warp shell as long as possible! Transfer emergency power to the antimatter containment system! Maintain position! Mister La Data, report! Are you saying that it worked? We collapsed the anomaly? Did it work? What about my crew? Thank you. You had a hand in helping me get out of this. I sincerely hope that this is the last time that I find myself here. When I realised the paradox. Q, what is it that you're trying to tell me? Mister Worf, what's the date? No. No. No. I think I'll get back to bed. I could use some sleep. No. I, er, I just thought that I might, erm, I might join you this evening. If there's room. Oh, er, thank you, Mister Data. Actually, I used to be quite a card player in my youth, you know. I should have done this a long time ago. So. Five card stud, nothing wild, and the sky's the limit.</td>\n",

It was all very romantic, very intense, probably because we both knew I would be leaving in two weeks.

As simple as that. It's hardly simple, Data, to negotiate a friendly agreement for Starfleet to use the base while at the same time snoop around finding how and why the life form there built it. Data, how can you be programmed as a virtual encyclopedia of human information without knowing a simple word like snoop? It means to spy, to sneak. Exactly, yes. Shut off that damned noise. Go to Yellow Alert. Reverse power, full stop. That's quite a directive. Would you mind identifying what you are? Data, call medics. He would not have injured you. Do you recognise this, the stun setting? What? That nonsense is centuries behind us. Most certainly I deny it. I agree we still were when humans wore costumes like that, four hundred years ago. But even when we wore costumes like that we'd already started to make rapid progress. Yes you can, Lieutenant Yar. No. The same old story is the one we're meeting now. Self-righteous life forms who are eager not to learn but to prosecute, to judge anything they don't understand or can't tolerate. We've no fear of what the true facts about us will reveal. Sense anything, Commander? From this point, no station aboard, repeat no station, for any reason will make use of transmitted signals or intercom. We'll try and take them by surprise. Let's see what this galaxy class starship can do. Lieutenant, inform engine room to prepare for maximum acceleration. Records search, Data. Results of detaching saucer section at high warp velocity. Search theoretical. Using print-out only, notify all decks to prepare for maximum acceleration. Now hear this, Maximum, you're entitled to know, means that we'll be pushing our engines well beyond safety limits. Our hope is to surprise whatever that is out there, try and outrun it. Our only other option is to tuck tail between our legs and return to Earth as they demand. Stand by. Engage. Steady on that. Continue accelerating. Counsellor, at this point I'm open to guesses about what we've just met. Beyond? Are you sure? Reverse angle. Worf, inform the engine room we need more. Go to yellow alert. Arm aft photon torpedoes. Place them on ready status. Now hear this. Print-out message, urgent, all stations on all decks. Prepare for emergency saucer sever. You will command the saucer section, Lieutenant. You are a Starfleet officer, Lieutenant. Make the mark, Data. Note in ship's log that at this startime, I'm transferring command to the battle bridge. Lieutenant, your torpedoes must detonate close enough to the hostile to blind it at the moment we separate. Worf, this is the Captain. At the moment of separation, we will reverse power just enough to get your saucer section out ahead and clear of us. Begin countdown. Mark. Let's come to a stop. Reverse power. Dead stop. We'll hold this position and wait for them. Lieutenant, are you recommending we fight a life form that can do all those things? I'd like to hear your advice. Thank you, conn. Commander, signal the following in all languages and on all frequencies. We surrender. State that we are not asking for any terms or conditions. Mid twenty first century. The post-atomic horror. But these courts happened in the past. Can we assume you mean this will be a fair trial? Tasha, no. You've got a lot to learn about humans if you think you can torture us or frighten us into silence. Will she live? Or what? Or this? Her death? Or worse? You promised the prisoners will not be harmed. We plead nothing so long as you break your own rules. I suggest you are now having second thoughts it. You are considering that if you conduct a fair trial, which was your promise, you may lose. Yes, even though you're judge and prosecutor. Accepted, so long as you keep to your agreement. And assaulting prisoners is hardly a fair trial. court of fact! We humans know our past, even when we're ashamed of it. I recognise this court system as the one that agreed with that line from Shakespeare. Which led to the rule guilty until proven innocent. Grievously savage could mean anything. I will answer only specific charges. I see no charges against us, Your Honour. Guilty. Provisionally. We question whether this court is abiding by its own trial instructions. Have I have permission to have Commander Data repeat the record? These will be your own words, your Honour. What exactly what followed his Honour's statement that the prisoner will not be harmed? Alright! We agree there is evidence to support the court's contention that humans have been savage. Therefore I say test us. Test whether this is presently true of humans. There must be many ways we can be tested. We have a long mission ahead of us. We've heard that we may find it rather interesting. Do we have clearance? Make it so. Is the viewer ready? We'll first bring you up to date on a little adventure we had on our way here, Commander. Then we'll talk. Welcome aboard. Inform them we'll connect as soon as they arrive. And sent the Commander to me when he's finished. Come. It seems we're alive only because we have been placed on probation. A very serious kind of probation. Go. Acknowledged. Commander Riker will conduct a manual docking. Picard out. You've reported in, haven't you? You are qualified? Then I mean now, Commander. A fairly routine manoeuvre but you handled it quite well. I do have some questions for you though. I see in your file that Captain DeSoto thinks very highly of you. One curious thing, however, you refused to let him beam down to Altair Three. I see. A Captain's rank means nothing to you. Isn't it just possible that you don't get to be a Starfleet Captain without knowing whether it's safe to beam down or not? Isn't it a little presumptuous of a first officer to second guess his captain's judgment? Always. And you don't intend to back off that position? One further thing. A special favour. Using the same kind of strength you showed with Captain DeSoto, I would appreciate it if you can keep me from making an ass of myself with children. I'm not a family man, Riker, and yet, Starfleet has given me a ship with children aboard. And I don't feel comfortable with children. But, since a captain needs an image of geniality, you're to see that's what I project. Welcome to the Enterprise, Commander Riker. Did you signal the Hood, Commander Riker? What was my answer, computer? Lieutenant! Do you intend to blast a hole through the viewer? If the purpose of this is to test humans, your honour, we must proceed in our own way. But futilely. Of course you will. We've a long voyage ahead of us. We do exactly what we would do if this Q never existed. If we're going to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are. Personal log, stardate 41153.8. Of the twenty four hours Q allotted us to prove ourselves, eleven have now passed without incident. And yet I cannot forget Q's prediction that we will face some critical test. And it's your belief that this is what made it possible for them to construct this base to Starfleet standards? Perhaps it's like those incidents you describe in your report as almost magical attempts to please us. None of it suggests anything threatening. If only every life form had as much desire to please. Ready to beam down? I'm looking forward to meeting this Groppler Zorn. As if it's something Q is doing to trick us? Over here. I've asked the Counsellor to join us in this meeting. May I introduce our new First Officer, Commander William Riker. Commander Riker, this is our ship's Counsellor, Deanna Troi. Have the two of you met before? Excellent. I consider it important for my key officers know each other's abilities. My crew and I need a bit more information before we make our recommendations to Starfleet. Good, since we admire what we've seen of your construction techniques. Starfleet may be interested in your constructing starbases elsewhere also. Counsellor? What is it? Yes. No secrets here if we're to be all to be friends. Agreed, Groppler? The source of this, Groppler. Do you have any idea? And that's it? No other comment? While evading even our simplest questions about it. We'll adjourn for now while we all reconsider our positions. Fine. I hope they find you as tasty as they did their past associates. Very good, Commander. Good idea. Children are not allowed on the Bridge. Doctor Crusher. Your son? Well, as long as he's here. I knew your father, Wesley. Want a look around? But don't touch anything! Try it out. The panel on your right is for log entries, library computer access and retrieval, viewscreen control, intercoms, and so on. Here we have The forward viewscreen is controlled from the ops position there How the hell do you know that, boy? Off the bridge! Both of you. Picard. Go ahead. Have Commander Riker and his team beam back up. Security, could that be the Hood returning here? Put it on main viewer. Identification? Hail it. Raise all shields, phasers at ready. Get me Groppler Zorn. And continue universal greetings on all frequencies. Zorn, an unidentified vessel has entered into orbit with us. Do you know who it is? I asked if you knew who it is. You mentioned the Ferengi Alliance to me. Are you certain? Sensor scans, Mister Worf. Bring photon torpedoes to ready! Tune that down! Commander Riker, come in. Can you hear me? Commander Riker, come in. Where are you? And Farpoint Station? Any damage there? It's from an unidentified vessel that's entered into orbit with us here. No ID, no answer to our signals. Understand, Commander. Would you object to your Captain ordering a clearly illegal kidnapping? Groppler Zorn may have the answers we need. Get him. Bring him here. They're forcing a difficult decision on me, Counsellor. We are in the midst of diplomatic discussions with them. Lieutenant, lock phasers on that vessel. Get off my bridge! We've no idea who is on that vessel. My order was a routine safety precaution. Captain to CMO. Are you reading any of this? Compliments on that, Doctor. Any questions? Starfleet people are trained to render aid and assistance whenever Let's consider your thoughts. You call us savages and yet you knew those people down there would be killed. It is your conduct that is uncivilised. Go to manoeuvring jets. Position us between that vessel and the planet. Force fields full on. From the same source as before? That is enough, damn it! An agreement which you are at this moment breaking by taking over our vessel, interfering with my decisions. Either leave or finish us. Do nothing that he asks. I'll risk none of my crew on that unknown. At least you impressed him, Number One. That's hopeful. I'll attend to my duty. I see nothing so bitter about that. I didn't want you thinking me harsh. Cold blooded. I didn't welcome you aboard personally, professionally. I made you come to me on the Bridge. I yelled at your son. Who, as you pointed out, was quite correct. He does seem to have a very good grasp of starship operations. Ah, but, now, your assignment here. I would consider and approve you a transfer for you. Hardly. Your service record shows you're just the Chief Medical Officer I want. I'm trying to be considerate of your feelings, Doctor. For you to work with a commanding officer who would continually remind you of a terrible personal tragedy. You requested this posting? Ah. Then, welcome aboard, Doctor. I, er, I hope we can be friends? Transporter chief, yank them back now! Riker, acknowledge! Transporter Chief, do you have their coordinates? Transporter Chief! Transporter Chief, come in! I've people in trouble over there, Q. Everyone at ease. That's an order. Q, my people are in trouble. Let me help them, please. I'll do whatever you say. It seems I did make that bargain. No! Do nothing he demands. Was there a reason? If you'd earned that uniform you're wearing, you'd know that the unknown is what brings us out here. Let's test that. Beginning with the tunnels you have under Farpoint, Groppler. In return for some pain you'd given other creature? Thank you. That was the missing part. Lieutenant Yar, rig main phaser banks to deliver an energy beam. And into specific patterns of matter, just as our transporters do. Groppler, you captured something like that, didn't you? Transmit the message, leave Farpoint Space Station immediately. Attacking those who had captured, capture its mate. Lock it in on Farpoint Station. Let it have whatever it can absorb. Energise. Discontinue. Groppler Zorn, there'll soon be no Farpoint Station, if I'm right about this. Which your world furnishes you in plenty. Only enough to keep it alive, so that you could force it to shape itself into whatever form you needed! Why do you use other lifeforms for recreation? Leave us! We've passed your little test. Get off my ship. All stations? Some problem, Riker? Oh no, Number One. I'm sure most will be much more interesting. Let's see what's out there. Engage.   \n",

Are you certain? Yes, of course you are. Picard here. But there were eighty people on that ship, Number One. Give me a theory, Doctor. Anything. Madness? Mass hysteria? Delusion? All right. Let's bring the away team back. Set the transporter to maximum decontamination, and then full examination and observation when they're here. Picard here. Go ahead, Doctor. Do we have a problem, Doctor? Affirmative. Make it a ship-wide search, Lieutenant. Take the helm, Mister Crusher. Set a course for thirty seven mark one hundred eighty. Warp six. Chief Engineer, report to the Bridge. Commander Riker, report to the Bridge. Doctor Crusher, report to the Bridge. He wasn't violent? Thank you, Lieutenant. Doctor, every person on that ship over there died. Is there any chance that whatever did it is loose on my ship? The entire crew somehow managed to kill themselves, Doctor. If it's not a disease, what else could have made them do that? Security just told me that he was longing for normal eyesight. That's a sudden yearning for that.  Which somehow resulted in complex strings of water molecules which acquired carbon from the body and acted on the brain like alcohol. Data, download this information to Medical immediately. Fascinating! The entire crew going out of control, Until they found this formula, barely in time. Picard to Doctor Crusher, come in. You can relax, Doctor. The answer to all of this is feeding into your medical banks right now. Including a cure. Absolutely. Picard here. Counsellor, it's not actually an infection. Thank you, Counsellor. Number One, it seems our Security Chief has the equivalent of a snootful. Forget it. Picard to Crusher. Have you made a test injection yet? We're getting indications that this condition is spreading. Why so slow? How much danger from that star? Worse case. Picard to Engineering. Chief Engineer report to the Bridge. Assistant Chief Engineer Shimoda, report to Medical. What? I did no such thing. I want you down in the Engine room just in case we need to move out of here. Attention all decks, all divisions. Effective immediately, I have handed over control of this vessel to Acting Captain Wesley Crusher. Acting Captain? Number One, MacDougal, get that boy out of Engineering. Such as? Metaphysics? Captain to Security, come in! Where is my security chief! Get me Lieutenant Yar. Lieutenant, where are you? All right, Lieutenant, you just stay right there. Data, please go to Lieutenant Yar and take her down to Sickbay. Captain to Security, I want all your senior supervisors to report to the Bridge immediately. What have you learned, Number One? Can you short out the power? Do it! Wes, this is Captain Picard. Do you see me? You will now return control of this vessel to the Bridge where it belongs. At once. Because ship captains control their own vessels, young man! Stand by a moment on that. Wesley. Wes. Are you aware that you're acting strangely, that a kind of infection was brought over from the Tsiolkovsky which acts like intoxication? That's a very adult bit of reasoning, Wes, Because, because you've lost the capacity for self-judgment. Now, alcohol does this, Wesley. But this contaminant we've brought back from the Tsiolkovsky does it even more so. Oh, it's very important I do, Wesley, because I must immediately lock a tractor beam onto the Tsiolkovsky, then tow it out of, Wesley! Wesley! Conn, where are you headed? What the hell is happening in Engineering? Captain to. Wesley. Wesley Crusher, come in! Ah, Data. At least you're functioning. Data, intoxication is a human condition. Your mind is different, it's not the same as Doctor, But. Damn it. Now, Doctor Do you know what the infection is? Come on, quickly. What sort of thing? Doctor, there must be a cure. Some formula, similar to the old one, Not now, Doctor. Please. Take us Worf, you know what to do. Take us er Right. Override. What, what's that? What's that, Wesley? Beverly. You will address me as Captain. I will? That's true. I started off calling you Beverly, and of course, naturally, you. I'm still not thinking straight. If that's something you were going to test, Decades ago, light years away, Okay, Bev. Yes, and Wesley may have given us a few seconds, too. Fair's fair. And let's credit his science teacher, too. To many people. I put it to you all. I think we shall end up with a fine crew, if we avoid temptation. So, Number One, let's go to our next job.   \n",

                                              On our way. You have the helm, Mister Data. Cargo One. This should be an interesting experience. It's their way, Lieutenant. Do they have our coordinates? This is Captain Picard aboard the Starfleet vessel Enterprise. Please do us the honour of visiting our vessel. Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Welcome aboard. These are my officers. My second in command, Commander William Riker. Ship's Counsellor, Deanna Troi. And my Security Officer, Lieutenant Natasha Yar. Yes, Lutan, that is her expertise. Lutan, we are aware of many of your planet's achievements, and its unique similarity to an ancient Earth culture we all admire. On behalf of the Federation, therefore, I would like to present this token of our gratitude and friendship. From China's Sung Dynasty, Fourteenth Century. Ah, yes, indeed. If you require respect from us, I am sure that you will see it. If there is something else, any further courtesy? And used for many other things too. Commander Riker, perhaps you and Counsellor Troi will demonstrate. Very well. Understanding has made friends of many different people. We've had a good beginning, Lutan. Picard to Bridge. Red alert. What comm. contact have we had with them? Make contact there and on all hailing frequencies. This is the Enterprise to Lutan and the Ligonian government. You have committed an unfriendly act. We insist that you reply immediately. Set them for a display blast a thousand metres short of the planet's surface. Fire. This is Captain Picard of the Enterprise with a message to Lutan, whom I have so far acknowledged as a friend. But you have now committed what our laws regard as an attack upon us. Since you have visited our vessel, you most certainly know the power of it. We insist that you reply to this message. Opinion, Counsellor. Will they injure Lieutenant Yar? Other comments? Yes, Doctor? You were testing if you can replicate the vaccine. I'm aware of that, Doctor. That's true. But I have seen my share of death. Perhaps the good ones never get them. What? Oh, yes. Alright. Well, yes, speaking as a mother. Wesley? No. Why don't you sit at Ops next to Lieutenant La Forge. Is the whole ship deaf?! Sit down over there, young man. Temporarily. Excuse me. Doctor Crusher, some of this may interest you. Lets hear the analysis. Mister Data, the French language for centuries on Earth represented civilisation. Well, Lutan, what do you want? What is required is an image of Lieutenant Yar, well and Ask for her? And now, Lutan, you have boldly taken Lieutenant Yar from us, and we ask that you now please return her. Lutan is a fortunate man. You've met Counsellor Troi. Then, sir, the courtesy of seeing Lieutenant Yar. I'd like to see her now. Such as the politeness of saying please before abducting someone? Yours is a different world. Have you been treated well, Lieutenant? My ship's company and I are certain of your gentle wisdom in that. Something to be carefully avoided. I agree. Until tonight, Lutan. Lutan, you have granted us hospitality and the safety of your Centreplace]. The gifts you give us are rare and precious. We thank you. And now, according with the customs of your ancestors, whom we honour and respect, I am here in peace to ask for the return of Lieutenant Yar. You speak of a code of honour, but what you are saying now, according to our customs, is called an act of war. No! The challenge is unequivocally refused! Did you have any idea, Lieutenant, that Lutan was suddenly going to announce that he wanted you for his First One? Tell me what you know about this? We're all being manipulated, Lieutenant, myself most of all. That thought had passed through my mind, Counsellor. If anything, even worse than we'd heard. You have nothing to prove anything here, Lieutenant. Counsellor, you're the last person I'd expect to argue in favour of accepting the challenge. The odds are. I want some explanations from Lutan. It's a great pity you began by abducting my Security Officer, Lutan, because I should tell you I do admire the hospitality you offer here. Some of it I do understand. She is a rather lovely female. Nothing. Well, almost nothing in my position of ship's Captain. But it puzzles me. If you feel that way for Tasha, why have you challenged her to a fight to the death? Ah, but you are also a man of great importance and wealth. Ah, I see. You, too, understand the proper value of women. You are a truly clever person, Lutan. You stand to lose nothing, either way the challenge goes. I will order Lieutenant Yar to fight. And may your cloak bring you all you deserve. Lock in on this location. Energise. You've both seen the message about the plague? We need to know as much as possible about Ligonian armaments. Data, especially important is an analysis of their combat capabilities. Geordi, concentrate on their cutting edges, wherever applicable, durability, composition, weaknesses of material. From the perspective of Lieutenant Yar using them in combat with Lutan's wife. And that won't be known until combat begins. You're right, Data. It does sound like a joke. With the power of the Enterprise, we could overwhelm this place easily, just take what we want. Which means, of course That is, ironically, what this is about. By our standards, the customs here, their code of honour, is the same kind of pompous, strutting charades that endangered our own species a few centuries ago. We evolved out of it because no one else imposed their own. I'm sorry, this is becoming a speech. Not entitled to ramble on about something everyone knows. Carry on. Then help me, please. What is a way out of this? Poison? What about those lengths of metal in the yard outside? Thank you, Data. Go ahead, Riker. We're alone. Thank you, Number One. Lieutenant, do you still feel that you want to go through with this challenge? Do you judge your condition good? Stay alive. We'll hope to do the rest. Exactly what do you find unfair, Lutan? They fought to the death. You saw the final blow. You know the effects of your poison. I certainly won't stop her, if she cares to claim that honour. Picard here. No problem, Number One. Send down a medical team. Five to beam up. Energise. This way, gentlemen. The challenge was carried out. She died, Lutan. Lutan, we can provide you with records of her death and how Doctor Crusher brought her back. What? Wesley. Well, thanks again for manning one of our bridge stations, Wesley. We'll see that you have another chance. So what's the delay, Number One? Why aren't we warping out of here?   \n",

What is their course? Identify. Reduce to impulse power. Fully enlarge. Very impressive design. But that does not mean identical, however. Damage report? Negative, Number One. They're just reacting to our close pursuit. Fall back a bit but stay with them. Open hailing freq. Why are we gaining on them? Don't anticipate. I read that, too. Lieutenant Yar, what do your sensors show? We need more information. What the hell are they are using? Considerably. It appears the Ferengi have us right where they want us. In their sights. Are you searching all frequencies? Any sign of any kind of messages? Weapons report, Lieutenant. Engineering, give me status on power recovery. Engineering, come in. Why aren't they answering? La Forge. Get me a full report from Engineering. Counsellor? It still makes it our move. If so, the question becomes how will they use that knowledge? Data, do you have any information touching this on any file? What kind of traders? Engineering? Join La Forge down below in Engineering, Number One. Without warp capacity, we're just a floating target. I understand the allusion. Colours representing countries at a time when they competed with each other. Red, white and blue for the United States. Whereas the French more properly used the same colours in the order of blue, white and red. That's enough, Data. We're discussing the Ferengi. I wish I had some clue as to what they will do next. Yes, Data, that is a natural assumption. Engineering? I wonder what they're thinking over there. And nothing shameful in a strategic retreat, either. Excellent, La Forge. Now let's, er, let's throw them off guard. Lieutenant Yar. Open hailing frequencies. At least we won't begin with weakness. Attention Ferengi starship! This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise. In the name of the United Federation of Planets, I demand you return the T9 energy converter you removed from Gamma Tauri Four. Send that in all language forms. Sometimes, Riker, the best way to win a fight is not to be there. Glad the Academy's still teaches the strategies of Sun Tzu. This delay had better prove out, LaForge. Let's blast full power into warp nine. Ready? On a count of three. Stand by on phasers. One, set warp to nine. Two, divert shield power to the main engines. Three. Merde. Shields up. What's wrong? Data, consult the charts on this planet. See what we've got on it. Conference evaluation. So, while we still have some power left, it is time for difficult decisions. Opinions please. Impractical and provocative. Even assuming that we have the power to sustain such a tactic. Your point, Counsellor? It's been tried. No response. La Forge? Other opinions? Thank you for your advice. Will? I haven't had your assessment. The only one remaining is the one that needs no conversation. The only one we must avoid. The one that leads to total annihilation. Open hailing frequencies. Attention, Ferengi starship. This is Captain Picard. It is obvious that we are in a situation here which needs resolving, and we are willing to do whatever is required, whatever is necessary. I would like, I would request, that you present your terms to us. Ready, but hold on ready. Open hailing frequencies. Ferengi vessel, we are awaiting your response. We'll wait a bit more, Number One. Patience. Patience. Who is speaking? What I said, DaiMon Tarr, is Something has seized their ship too. They're in the same predicament as us. Launch a sensor probe. Set it to search for the source of whatever this something is that is holding both ships. Go back to hailing frequency, fast. And I regret, DaiMon Tarr, that I can no longer negotiate unless it is conducted visually. And it is against Starfleet orders to accept a surrender otherwise. Do you withdraw your surrender? Agreed, DaiMon Tarr. You should be able to view us now. Are we on your screen? Your offer may be inadequate, but I will discuss it with my staff. Stand by for further communications. Lieutenant, have you launched the probe? Well, if we're not holding the Ferengi and they're not holding us, who the hell is? Data, you were going to show us something. Trillions? I've never heard the word Tkon before. Data, what are you doing? Then get unstuck and continue with the briefing. Continue, Commander. We'll take it here. Reaching up from the planet surface. Amazing power. Data, what does the legend say about the end of the Tkon Empire? Could this planet have escaped that? We should take a look at it, Number One. Stand by with an away team. That's a complication. Maybe we should ask them to join us in this. We've been ordered to learn all we can about them. Do you know a better way? Understood. Open hailing frequencies. Ferengi vessel from Enterprise, come in. With regard to the surrender, DaiMon Tarr. The facts are somewhat different. Agreed. Perhaps you would agree to a more productive relationship? He recognises your interest in profit. Or is that an incorrect assumption? We did not attack you. We gave chase in order to recover a Federation-owned energy device which On the contrary, Gamma Tauri Four is recognised by all civilised members of All I'm saying is that you removed something which clearly did not belong to you. On the contrary, I have no wish to discuss issues of property or of territory, when our mutual problem remains. Like it or not, we are both trapped by this energy draining forcefield from the planet. I would like to propose a swap. It's a trade, an exchange. We will tell you what we know about the planet, and in trade, you will give us your information. We must trust each other, Tarr. I propose that we test this relationship by cooperating in a joint exploration of the planet surface. The profit, DaiMon Tarr, of saving all our lives. Agreed. If you care to join us, we have a well-proven transporter device Excellent. We will transmit the information shortly. Enterprise out. I would log that agreement as promising, at least. Take him. And be careful, Number One. A lot. Even in orbital space it'll get below minus two hundred degrees. Feels like that right now. Good. Thank you. I've diverted the reserve power to the family decks. They'll last longest. Is there anything else we can do, Doctor? Where's Wesley? You shouldn't. He has the right to meet death awake. Rubbish Compliments, Lieutenant. Lieutenant Worf. You've done well. I commend your performance, Number One. Make it so.   \n",

They're not authorised to make any alterations in our engines, and according to Starfleet's report, they will simply test different ways of entering warp speed and different intermix formulas. What's the harm in that? Gibberish? Then how do you explain Starfleet's report that the same tests on the USS Ajax and on the Fearless over there, resulted in a measurable increase in propulsion. Stand by for Commander Riker, Chief. He's on his way. Since you're concerned about these tests. Very good. Engineering, this is the Bridge. It's your call. Affirmative, Number One. Are you ready? La Forge, set in warp one point five. Engage. What is our velocity? Reverse engines. Because no one has gone this fast. Reverse engines. All stop. Position? Position, Mister La Forge. That's not possible. Data, what distance have we travelled? I can't accept that. Mister Data! Just explain what brought us here. What is he saying, Number One? Considering where we are, we must assume it isn't. Thrill? Yes, but isn't the real point, can you do it again? Can you get us home? Commander Riker will join you in a moment. Comment is invited. Counsellor? Spoken like a true Starfleet graduate. It is tempting, eh, Number One? I know that if Kosinski can get us home, Starfleet can use his technique to bring back a pure science vessel to do even more. Number One, tell Kosinski prepare to get us out of here. Standing by, Number One. As before Begin at warp one point five. All stop. Yes, but where is this place? Data, you have the helm. I'll be in Engineering. What's wrong? Ensign, what are you doing? Maman? This can't be. You've been Yes, I've felt that. But why now, suddenly. We believe it the outer rim. Maman, do you understand these things? Can you tell me where my ship is? What is this place? Just a moment, Number One! No. No, let's help all of us. General quarters. Red Alert. I had to get everyone's attention. It was the quickest way. This is the Captain. This is not a drill. It seems that in this place, the world of the physical universe and the world of ideas is somehow intermixed. What we think Also becomes a reality. We must, therefore, I repeat, must begin controlling our thoughts. We will give you more on this as our understanding increases. The Enterprise will stay at full alert until the crisis is over. What did you do? What are you talking about? How could you? How could any of us? If you knew something, why didn't you say so? He's unconscious. Why? What does that mean? He mustn't. He's the only one who can get us back. Cause? What is the boy doing here? He knows. We all know. Will he live? Wake him. We don't have that luxury. Wake him. Doctor. Wes. We all have other friends aboard this ship, too. If we stay here much longer we may lose the ability to distinguish between thought and reality. Now, regardless of the risk, wake him. Now. Do you recognise me? I'm the Captain and I need answers. Who are you? Or what? Traveller? What is your destination? Yes, what place are you trying to reach? Then what is the purpose of your journey? That's not an answer. Until now. Our reality? And in order to satisfy this curiosity, you have brought my ship and my crew into great risk. Some mistakes? What mistakes could possibly explain these incredible explosions of velocity? I believe there may be a warp speed that can get us beyond Galaxy M Thirty Three, but there is no velocity of any magnitude that can possibly bring us wherever this is. Is it true what our navigation sensors are telling us? Are we millions of light years away from where we were? Well, what got us here? Thought? No. No, it actually makes sense to me. Only the power of thought could explain what has been happening. Especially out here. Chaos. What we think is what happens. What's happening? Revive him. Unless he was distracted by something. Do you have any facts that fit this? Can you get us back? And we report our observations how? To whom? Can you get us back? Number One, take him down to main Engineering. I'll be on the Bridge. Strange how he seems to care for you. The boy? I must get my ship back. Do we have time for this? Encourage him in what? Somewhat. We're going to get back home. Take him to Engineering. I'll be on the Bridge. Put it out! Think! Put the flame out in your thoughts. Now, Get to your station and concentrate on your assignment. Do you have any further advice, Counsellor? All decks, all stations. This is the Captain speaking. All decks, I must have your full attention. In a few moments, as we attempt to warp back home, it is vital, absolutely vital, that you centre your thoughts on your duty or on the welfare of the one called the Traveller. Think of giving him some of your strength. Now, this is an order. You must try to do this. And now, attempt to concentrate completely on your duty of the moment. Or on the Traveller, on his well being. Think of him as someone you care deeply about. All decks, all stations. Battle stations. Helm, set in warp one point five, retroactive course. Bridge to Engineering. Stand by. On my order, Mister Data, Mister La Forge. Engage. It's not happening. It's not enough. Cease Red Alert. Gone? Attention all decks. This is to inform you that with your support the Traveller has returned us to our galaxy. However, he has now left us. Wherever he has gone, we wish him well. Have the boy sent to the Bridge, Number One. Our next assignment is on this heading? Mister Data, Mister La Forge, increase to warp five. Same heading. Ah, Wesley. Come on the Bridge. Move! Commander Riker has told me how supportive you were in Engineering. Well done. At ease. Sit here in Command. Oh, that's true. Well, I can't waive them again. Only commissioned officers. Please don't interrupt me, Wesley. Any commissioned rank? Even ensign? Well, then, I'll have to make him an acting ensign. Captain's log, stardate 41263.4. For outstanding performance in the best of Starfleet tradition, Wesley Crusher is made Acting Ensign, with the duties and privileges of that rank. And whether that rank becomes permanent, Mister Crusher, depends on you. At the earliest opportunity, your entrance application for Starfleet Academy will be tendered. Until then, you will learn this ship. Every operation, every function. Commander Riker, a duty schedule for Mister Crusher, heavy on study. Meanwhile, you can sit here and learn something. Why? Is someone ill? Or would you rather tell her about this, Wes?   \n",

Yes. And, as it would seem we're in for a relatively quiet time, I shall use this opportunity to visit the Hatarian System. There are some ancient ruins that are just being excavated. We could use this time to recalibrate the weapon targeting array. Mister Worf? Very good. Dismissed. Lieutenant, could I have a word with you for a moment? I noticed several times during the briefing that you appeared to be a bit distracted. Is everything all right? Oh, I see. But he's had so little opportunity to spend time with Klingons. You know, the festival of Kot'baval is tomorrow. If he could take part in that, I'm sure he would more fully appreciate what a rich cultural heritage he comes from. There is the Klingon outpost on Maranga Four. I'm sure they'll be celebrating the festival. The Enterprise could be there in a fraction of the time, and still be back in time for the rendezvous. Mister Worf, Stellar Dynamics would like nothing better than a trip around the nebula.   \n",

                                                                                                            Report. On screen. Open a channel. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard Isolate the bandwidth. Let the signal through the shields. Bok! Mister Worf, put a tractor beam on that probe. Determine if it's safe to beam it aboard. I want to know where it came from. Mister Data, see if there is any mention of a Jason Vigo in Federation records. You might start with Miranda Vigo. She was born on New Gaul about fifty years ago. Number One, contact the Ferengi Government. Find out all you can about Bok. He was wearing a DaiMon's uniform. If he's regained his rank, I want to know why. Come. How old is the boy now? Picard to Bridge. Set a course for the Camor system, warp five. Will, I do appreciate your not asking, but I do think that you have a right to know. There is a possibility that the boy is my son. I was involved with his mother for a short time about twenty four years ago. We met through a friend when I was on shore leave on Earth. It was all very romantic, very intense, probably because we both knew I would be leaving in two weeks. And we kept in touch for a while, but we never managed to get together again. No, so either Bok is wrong and I'm not the father, or Miranda decided to raise the child alone, which quite frankly wouldn't surprise me. She was very independent, very strong willed. But whether he's my son or not, he's in danger. Bok tried to kill me six years ago, and I don't doubt he will try to make good his threat against the boy. What about his mother? Miranda was trained as a botanist. She always used to talk about running a farm one day. Maybe we should concentrate on the agricultural areas. There cannot be many non-Camorites among them. Scan for human life signs. What about males? That's seven. You said there were eight. Male or female? Unless he were forced to. Relay his coordinates to the transporter room. Have them beam him aboard. That's right. I'm Captain Picard. Jean-Luc Picard. We thought you were at risk. Are you Jason Vigo? In a manner of speaking. Someone has made a threat against his life. Jason, I'm an old friend of your mother's. I'm here because you're in danger. The person who has made the threat is under the impression that you are my son. I don't know. Maybe we should contact her. Oh, I'm sorry. Jason, I think it's important that we find out one way or another. Would you be willing to permit a genetic test? I doubt it. What were you doing in the caves, Jason? Are you a seismologist? Without an antigrav harness? So, what do you do? I see. Oh, theses are archaeological fragments that I've collected over the years. This is a Silvan glyph stone. And this, this is a Gorlan prayer stick. It's really quite rare. Not really. Only to students of archaeology such as myself. Though I did have to hand over a bottle of very old Saurian brandy for it. Perhaps, but it's of value to me nonetheless. Would you like some tea? Something else? Tea, Earl Grey, hot. I'm sure this whole thing is as much a surprise to you as it is to me. I really want to be honest with you, Jason. I only knew your mother for a very short time. I would have liked to have known her better. It just didn't work out that way. You look a lot like her, you know. It's the eyes, I think. I would like to make one thing clear, Jason. Your mother never told me about you. If she had, I would have been part of your life. I think it would be better if you stayed on board the Enterprise until we have resolved this situation with Bok. Years ago, I was forced to destroy a starship commanded by his son. Bok apparently feels that it would be fitting vengeance to kill my son. Of course not. We are trying to locate Bok now. I want to confront him, settle this matter. I assure you there is no one more eager to put this behind us than I am. We'll get you some quarters. Jason. Your being here? I hope it will give us the chance to get to know each other. Understood. Put it on screen. Thank you for taking the time to talk to us, DaiMon. Yes, it concerns DaiMon Bok. But he's no longer there? I see. Do you know his whereabouts now? But that cluster consists of more than twenty star systems. Plot a course. Take us out of orbit. I think I need to talk to a parent. I'm not sure that I can tell you. He puts up so many barriers I have no idea what's underneath. Perhaps. But surely it would be wrong to force the issue. My sense is that he's a very independent young man. Perhaps it would be best if I left him alone. Let him come to me if he wants to. Security to Captain's quarters immediately. Could it have been another hologram? Bok once used a mind control device to make me hallucinate. Good. Keep me posted. Mister Worf, I want you to assign a security detail to Jason. I am not the target of Bok's threats. Jason is. Criminal record? Trespassing? Thank you, Mister Data. Good morning. Because Bok appeared in my quarters last night. Now, it might not have been him. It may have been an image. We're investigating. That wouldn't be wise. I'm sure you have, but Bok is a dangerous creature. He has a starship, he has technology. You seem to like rock climbing. The holodeck can create some very challenging climbs. We could go down together and I could show you how to use the programme. Perhaps we could climb together. I'm probably not as skilled as you, but I'm not inexperienced. Why didn't we detect it before? On screen. Is it another holographic device? A message? Can you translate it? He's proved that he can get to us whenever he wants. Why doesn't he do something? Tea, Earl Grey, hot. It's a risky game you're playing, coming here. Next time we'll be ready for you. Why don't we settle this now? It was self-defence. He fired on my ship. I didn't know that. If he'd told me I would have withdrawn. I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do to bring him back. You cannot put a price on a life. No. What do you mean degenerative? Is he going to be all right? I've been thinking about what you said the other day, and you know, I think you were right. I had convinced myself that Jason didn't want me to reach out to him. Well, I'm not sure that that is going to be enough. I've found out that Jason has a criminal record. It's nothing very serious, it's only petty theft and so forth, but I can't help feeling that if I had been part of his life then he wouldn't be so troubled now. And be patient. My understanding is that such devices were impractical. What range would that kind of transporter have? Is there any way we can keep Bok from beaming aboard the Enterprise again? If he has the ability to beam aboard, he may be able to beam someone away. I'm concerned that he may try to take Jason. Is there any way we can protect him? Make it so. Computer, where is Jason Vigo? Would you wait outside? I like climbing. There's something about actually having your fate in your own hands. It looks as though we may have found out how to locate Bok's ship. This could all soon be over. I thought it would make you feel better. Jason, when your mother and I parted, I lost track of her completely. But I would like to know more about what happened to her, if you wouldn't mind telling me. Well, how did you end up on Camor? It's an unlikely place for a woman and child. Yes, that was Miranda, all right. Oh. I see. I'm so sorry. Jason, isn't there some way that I can be a father to you? My own father and I were estranged. He wanted me to stay home and tend the vineyards and I wanted to join Starfleet. And he died before we could come to terms with that. And I've regretted that all of my life. I don't want the same thing to happen to you and me. You're so wrong. I know. Oh, yes, I know all about your troubles with the Camor authorities. It doesn't make any difference, Jason. You're still my son. And, like it or not, I'm your father. I don't know what that means, but it means something. There's some connection. But one thing is clear. You'll never look at your hairline again in the same way. You wanted to see me. Picard here. Have you been able to locate Bok's ship? Put it on screen. Plot a course. Maximum warp. The modifications you made to the transporter. Is there any way we could use a subspace transport from here to get me onto Bok's ship? I'll take that as a yes. You're with me. We'll deal with that when the time comes. Understood. Lower your weapons or Bok is dead. You know as well as I do, Bok, he's not my son. I know what you've done. Miranda Vigo is his mother but I am not his father. You made it appear so because you resequenced his DNA. But your technique was flawed. He developed a neurological disorder. When my ship's Doctor investigated it, she discovered what you had done. There never was a ransom. All he was ever interested in was vengeance. He's not a DaiMon. He was stripped of command. He lied to you so that you would help him in his plan. The Enterprise is closing in on your position. If you let the two of us go, they won't attack you. They will cripple your vessel and keep you here until the Ferengi authorities arrive. You've got a lot deal of explaining to do. Your only hope is to turn Bok over to them and tell them that he deceived you. I'm glad to hear it. Are you sure that you wouldn't like to stay on board the Enterprise for a few more days? I understand. I will. I put a little something into your bag while you were packing. I know you'd probably have preferred a bottle of Saurian brandy, but that's all I could come up with. I want you to have it. Energise.   \n",

Yes, but Data, this is a play. The audience has to see you. There, that's much better. Now, do you want to try it again? Well, Data, Shakespeare was witnessing the end of the Renaissance and the birth of the modern era, and Prospero finds himself in a world where his powers are no longer needed. So, we see him here about to perform one final creative act before giving up his art forever. Yes, but there's a certain expectancy too. A hopefulness about the future. You see, Shakespeare enjoyed mixing opposites. The past and the future. Hope and despair. Data, what is this? Is this part of your programme? What is going on? A train? Computer, end programme. Computer, end programme. Oh yes, I know. I'll get it seen to, Data. Yes, yes, Data, I know about the Orient Express. But what is it doing on Prospero's Island? Is it possible that this malfunction will affect the other holodecks as well? Very good, Data. But shut down the other holodecks until you're finished, just to be on the safe side. I never realised that you were interested in trains. Are you aware that at its peak, the Orient Express carried more than ten thousand people a year? What then? I wonder what they talked about? Picard here. Very good. I'm on my way. Thank you. Well, let's move on to another survey region. Have stellar cartography begin a Mister Data, report. Picard to Engineering. Mister La Forge, what's going on? We've lost primary helm control on the Bridge. Mister Data, what's our heading? Begin the procedure, Mister La Forge. Well done, Mister La Forge. Well, I want an explanation Mister La Forge. Picard out. Have you found anything yet? Why didn't our sensors alert us? Geordi, what's going on? We just went into warp. Explain. And you think that the ship has somehow gone beyond those functions and is developing a new capacity? Processing centre? Very well. Mister Data, Mister Worf, I want you to go along. See if you can to re-establish control of the ship without damaging the nodes. If the ship is truly an emerging intelligence, then we have a responsibility to treat it with the same respect as any other being. Did everyone get out in time? I want you to send a team down there immediately. Find out what's going on. Picard here. What's going on? What is that object? Counsellor, did you draw any other conclusions from your experiences on the holodeck? Anything that would help us to understand this situation? Is there any way that we can persuade them to give back control of the ship? Is there a way that we can relate to them on their own level, find some way to influence their behaviour? Very well, Counsellor, go ahead. But bear in mind that whenever we have tried to hinder their efforts, we've failed. Perhaps it's time to cooperate with them. What's our heading? Vertion particles. Vertiform City. That's what the ship was looking for. Geordi, what's going on? Picard here. Yes, we've had a ship-wide shutdown. We've lost attitude control and most systems are offline. Are you suggesting that the Enterprise is trying to create a lifeform? Will it survive? Let's get back to the Bridge. Picard here. What's our course? Another white dwarf star. Will the object in the cargo bay survive that long? Mister Data, we have to stop the Enterprise. That means you have to get control of the train. The ship is looking for vertion particles and it believes that the Cordannas system is the closest source. Is there any possibility of anything closer? Then what about artificial ones? Can you create the particles? Well, we've got to give it a try. The nebula or the pulsar? It's your choice, Mister La Forge. Very well. Begin the torpedo modifications. Stand by. Are we within sensor range of the nebula? Mister Data, I need you to slow us to impulse speed. Are the modifications to the torpedoes complete? Launch torpedo. Then the purpose of the ship's intelligence was simply to bring this life form into being. Come. I would be honoured. What scene? O brave new world, that has such people in it. Why do you say that? And I have allowed it to go off on its merry way. The intelligence that was formed on the Enterprise didn't just come out of the ship's systems. It came from us. From our mission records, personal logs, holodeck programs, our fantasies. Now, if our experiences with the Enterprise have been honourable, can't we trust that the sum of those experiences will be the same?   \n",

                                                                             Lieutenant Ro. Please report to the Bridge. You seemed a bit overwhelmed by all the attention. You look very fit, Lieutenant. Tactical Training seems to agree with you. That school is more than a challenge. Half the class washes out every year. But somehow I didn't think you'd be one of those. Go ahead. Change course to intercept. I'm on my way. I'd like you at the conn, Lieutenant. Ensign Gates. Report. Can you identify them? On screen. Isolate one and magnify. The Maquis. Open a channel. To all Maquis ships. Call off your attack or we will be forced to engage you. You are Federation citizens. Your actions are in violation of our treaty with the Cardassians. Call off your attack. Mister Worf, are we in firing range? Arm phasers and photon torpedoes and stand by. Mister Worf, can you detonate a torpedo spread between the Maquis ships and the Cardassians? Do it. Signal the Cardassians that we're standing by to assist them if they have any wounded. Gul Evek. I'm sorry that we could not come to your aid sooner. I can assure you that is not the case. We're doing everything in our power to control them. I can assure you it was not through official channels. Starfleet does not condone the Maquis' actions in the Demilitarised Zone any more than your government would condone the paramilitary actions of Cardassian civilians. Considering that they destroyed a Juhryan freighter less than a week ago, I would say that your efforts are meeting with limited success. I thought twice was pushing it a little. You missed Gul Evek by a matter of hours. I asked him to stay. I thought that an Admiral's assurances might convince him that we are trying to deal with this Maquis situation. Gul Evek assured me that they had stopped that practice. Admiral, this Maquis situation has you worried. Perhaps you need an undercover operative. Because of your recent training, because you're Bajoran, and because of your past troubles with Starfleet gives you a certain credibility. Immediately. This is a rare case when our interests and theirs coincide. We both want peace in the Demilitarised Zone. We're all sympathetic, Lieutenant. Our civilian population in the Demilitarised Zone is in a very difficult situation, but even sympathy has to end at some point. The peace treaty isn't just a piece of paper. If the Maquis force us into a war with Cardassia, it could mean hundreds of thousands of lives. Two years ago, Starfleet would never have tapped you for this mission. They must have a lot of confidence in you now. Are there any other ships in the vicinity? Helm, set course for the Topin system. Mister Data, will you signal the science ship that we're on our way. Can we use our sensors to find them? Data, can you locate the signal? Can you decode it? Do it. Ro is on that ship? Let it through. Let it go. There must be someone with her. We should make it look as though we're trying to stop them. Mister Worf, lock phasers on their previous position and fire. Frankly, I find it hard to believe. Every ship that enters the Demilitarised Zone is being searched. You know, we could make use of that. We have come up with a plan that has the potential to seriously curtail the Maquis. We want to give them a target so threatening to them that they'll be willing to commit as many ships and people as possible in order to destroy it. Biogenic weapons, for example. You could provide them with intelligence that would show that the Cardassians are, in fact, supplying their colonists with them. You could tell them that in order to get past the check points, they're shipping the components for these weapons through third parties, and then we could put together a convoy and send it toward the Demilitarised Zone. We could station our ships in the Hugora Nebula to avoid detection. That's right. If you have a problem with any of this, I need to know it now. I knew that I could count on you. I hope not. I'd like that. Why? But there are only six ships. We could even cut back that number. Every intelligence report that I get from Starfleet suggests that the Maquis are eager to expand their strikes, they want to escalate their activities. Now you're telling me this isn't true? Laren, what's going on? Yes. What? Are you saying you want to back out of this mission? This has nothing to do with me. This is about you. If you back out now, you'll throw away everything you've worked for. We're committed to this mission. My only question for you is, can you carry out your orders? I could put you before a board of inquiry for having lied to me about this operation. I would certainly have you court-martialled if you sabotage it. Now, it's your decision. I feel it necessary to have Commander Riker go back with you. He can pose as a relative. I just want to make sure that nothing happens to obstruct this mission. I'm sorry. I don't have that kind of money. As soon as they cross the border, we'll intercept them. Go to Red alert. What the hell is she doing? Can you counter the effect? Have they crossed the border? When she comes aboard take her into custody.   \n",
       "1388  Counsellor! What's today's date? The date! 47988. I'm not sure. I don't know how or why, but I'm moving back and forth through time. I had this feeling I had physically left the Enterprise. I was in another time, another place. I was somewhere in the past. You see, it's all slipping away so fast. It's like waking up from a nightmare. It was years ago. It was before I took command of the Enterprise. I was talking to someone, I can't remember who. And then it all changed. I was no longer in the past. I was now an old man in the future, and I was outside and I was doing something. I can't remember what it was. I'm sorry, it's all gone. I just can't remember. No, no, it was much more than a dream. The smells, the sounds, the very touch of things, much more real than a dream. You see, I can't say. At first I had a sense of confusion, disorientation. I wasn't sure where I was. And then all that passed and it all seemed perfectly natural, as though I belonged in that time. But I can't Geordi. Oh, I haven't been called that for some time either. How about Jean-Luc? Good Lord, Geordi. Well, how long has it been? No, no, no. Since you last called me Captain, since we were all together on the Enterprise? Twenty five years. Well, time has been good to you. Oh, well, I'm just tying up some vines. How is Leah? What about the little ones, Brett, Alandra and er? Sidney. So what brings you here? Geordi, you don't make the trip from Rigel Three to Earth just to drop by. So, you've heard? I'm not an invalid. Irumodic Syndrome can take years to run its course. Well now that you're here, you can help me carry those tools. Well, my cooking may not be up to Leah's standards, but I can still make a decent cup of tea. Oh, I read your last novel. I thought that the protagonist a little too flamboyant, but for the rest I I'm sorry, Lieutenant. My mind must have wandered. What were you saying? No. Of course, I'm familiar with the blueprints and specifications, but this will be my first time aboard. I'm sure she is. No. It's just that you look very familiar. Tasha. I was just with Tasha in the shuttle. Actually, I really like running around the ship in my bare feet. A defect that you hadn't noticed before? If that's so, why do you look like you've just signed my death sentence? I wouldn't worry about it. Something tells me that you're going to have to put up with me for a long time to come. Has Worf found anything? I wasn't dreaming. Something happened. Go ahead, Mister Worf. Beverly? Mister Worf, will you route the call through to Doctor Crusher's office. Admiral. Is there any explanation why they would make such a blatantly aggressive move? What are our orders? Am I authorised to enter the Neutral Zone? Understood. This is not my time. I don't belong here. I was somewhere else a few moments ago. No, no, no! I was somewhere else. I was, it was a long time ago. There was someone talking. I was talking to someone. Beverly. I was talking to Beverly. I'm not senile, you know. This did happen. I was here, I was talking to you, and then I was somewhere else. I was on the Enterprise. I was back on the Enterprise. At least, I think that's where it was. I was in Sickbay. Well, it might have been a hospital. Yes, yes, I know what you're thinking. It's the Irumodic Syndrome. He's beginning to lose his mind, the old man. Well, it's not that. And I'm not daydreaming either. Data. I want to see Data. Because I think he can help. I don't know! I don't know! I want to see Data! Yes, I think he is. You see them, don't you? They're everywhere. They're laughing at me. Why are they laughing? Yes, Data. We'll go see Data. I know how it sounds but it happened. It was real. I was there, back on board the Enterprise. Tea? Earl Grey. Hot. Nothing. Well, Data, I must say, this is a fine place you have here. They certainly treat professors pretty well at Cambridge You say this is Earl Grey? I'd swear that it was Darjeeling. A week. They've prescribed peridaxon. Yes, I know, it's not a cure, There's nothing that can prevent the deterioration of the synaptic pathways. You think that I'm senile, that all this is just a delusion. That's the Data that I remember. I knew I could count on you. To Captain Jean-Luc Picard, stardate 41148 You are hereby requested and required to take command to take command of the USS Enterprise as of this date. Signed Rear Admiral Norah Satie, Starfleet Command. Red Alert! All crew to battle stations. Report. Noted. Counsellor, do you sense anything unusual on board the Enterprise? Perhaps an alien presence that doesn't belong here, maybe one operating on a level of intelligence far superior to our own? Mister Worf, initiate a level two security alert on all decks until further notice. No, of course not. Lieutenant, security alert two. We're on our way, Chief. This tells me that a large spatial anomaly has appeared in the Neutral Zone, in the Devron System. No, we'll proceed to Farpoint. You heard me. Mister Worf, will you man your station. I've no intention of explaining to anyone. We will proceed with our mission to Farpoint as planned. Chief O'Brien, am I right in thinking that you're having a problem with the warp plasma inducers. Well I know how to get them back online. You're with me. We'll be in main Engineering. Mister O'Brien, will you use these specifications to bypass the secondary plasma inducer. But the Chief Engineer isn't on board. Mister O'Brien, trust me. I know you can do it. All those years you spent as a child building those model starship engines. They were well worth it. From your Starfleet records. Commander Data, welcome on board. It's so very good to see you. I could use your help with the infuser array. As you can see, we're having difficulty with the plasma conduits. It happened again. Yes. It's still a little vague, but I can remember more this time. It seems that every time I shift periods, I can retain more memory. At first, it appeared that I was in the future, years from now, and then I was in the past just before our first mission. Counsellor, do you remember when I first came on board the Enterprise? What happened after the welcoming ceremony? Do you have any memory of my calling Red Alert in Spacedock? Do you remember Starfleet diverting us from Farpoint to the Neutral Zone to investigate a spatial anomaly? For all I know, I may find the same thing in the future. These are all very important questions, and perhaps I will find answers to them in the past, but now we have a potentially dangerous threat from the Romulans. I want all departments to present a battle readiness report to me at oh eight hundred hours tomorrow morning. Dismissed. I want continuous subspace sweeps. We may be able to detect a temporal disturbance. Will, this time shifting. When it happens I experience a momentary disorientation. If that should happen during a crisis, I want you to take command immediately. Number One? Speaking of disorientation, are you all right? You have the Bridge, Number One. I'll be in my Ready room. Come. What's this? Beverly. Yes, sir. What? Hey, Beverly? But you said yourself that this is only a possibility. I prefer to look on the future as something which is not written in stone. A lot of things can happen in twenty five years. Yes. What is it? Have we reached the Neutral Zone? Sorry. I was in the past again. What's going on? No, no, no. No, we have to get to the Neutral Zone. In the other two time periods, Starfleet reported a sort of a spatial anomaly in, in, in the Devron system. In Devron system in the Neutral Zone. If the anomaly appeared there in the past, then it might be here too and we have to find out. But if it is here, then it means something. Damn it, Geordi, I know what we have to do! Right. Right. Klingons. In this time period, the Klingons have taken over the Romulan Empire. I know that. I haven't completely lost my mind, you know. Right. Now, I think it's time to call in some old favours. Contact Admiral Riker, Starbase two four seven. Will, if this spatial anomaly really is in the Devron System. Well I don't believe it! What if their long range scanners are faulty? We have to go there and see for ourselves. Will, that is just not good enough. Damn him, anyway. After all we've been through together. He's been sitting behind that desk too long. Medical ship? Yes. Yes! I think I can arrange that. Data, find the USS Pasteur. I have some pull with the Captain. At least, I used to have. Let's just choose one. So, did you get my message? Oh. So that's why you married me. Yes, that's it. Worf. Yes, that's the answer. Worf will help us. So, you kept the name. No, I'm fine. I don't need rest. Look, you are treating me as if I am an invalid. I do have a few years left in me yet. I do not want to be led around, and I do not want to be patronised. Now, I'll go and get some rest. We'll find the anomaly. I know we will. Report. Is there anything unusual in the vicinity, Mister Data? There should be a barrier of some sort nearby. A large plasma field, highly disruptive. This is the right time, the right place. He should be here now. Q! We're here! This has gone on long enough! Counsellor, do you sense an alien presence? I don't understand. This is not the way it's supposed to happen. Maintain this position. I'll be in my Ready room. Q. I knew it. What's going on? The last time that I stood here was seven years ago. You accused me of being the representative of a barbarous species. We demonstrated to you that mankind had become peaceful and benevolent. You agreed and you let us go on our way. Now why am I standing here again? Are you putting mankind on trial again? Is there any connection between the trial seven years ago and whatever's going on now? The spatial anomaly in the Neutral Zone, is it related to what's happening? Is it part of a Romulan plot, a ploy to start a war? That's only four. Did you create the anomaly? Are you responsible for my shifting through time? Why? Guilty of what? We've journeyed to countless new worlds, we've contacted new species, we have expanded our understanding of the universe. We are what we are, and we're doing the best we can. It is not for you to set the standards by which we should be judged. You're going to deny us travel through space? Q, I do not believe that even you are capable of such an act. Me? What sort of meaningless doubletalk is this? Commander, assemble the senior staff and go to Red alert. We have a bigger problem than I thought. Normally I would agree with you, but this time I feel that somehow it is different. There was a deadly earnestness about him. I think he's serious. Which means that in some fashion, I am going to be the cause of the destruction of humanity. So what am I going to do? Lock myself in a room in all three different time periods? Agreed. I've been thinking about my conversation with Q. He admitted that he was responsible for my shifting through time. Now it occurred to me that he might be giving me a chance somehow to save humanity. Well, he's always had a certain fascination with humanity, with myself in particular. I think he has more than a passing interest in what happens to me. If I weren't travelling through time I would never have realized that the anomaly in the Neutral Zone appeared there in the past as well. Assuming that's an important piece of a larger puzzle, my ability to shift through time may be the key to understanding what's going on. Go ahead. We're on our way. All stop. Initiate long range scans. We are. Mister Worf, hail the Romulan flagship. On screen. But surely, Worf, you must still have some influence. We have to get into the Neutral Zone. Can't you just get us permission to cross the border? I don't care what kind of ship we go in. We have to get to the Devron System. I know that I'm an old man and I'm out of touch, but the Worf that I remember was more concerned with things like honour and loyalty than rules and regulations. But that was a long time ago. Maybe you're not the Worf once I knew. Because it always works, Worf. Your problem is that you really do have a sense of honour and you really do care about trust and loyalty. Don't blame me for knowing you so well. Terms accepted. Engage. Set a course for the Devron system, and engage at warp nine. I'm aware of that, Lieutenant. Carry out my orders, Chief. Yes of course, Counsellor. Contact Farpoint Station. I wish to speak with Commander Riker. They don't trust me. They think that I'm behaving erratically. I understand, but I also know what this crew is capable of, even if they don't. I know it's difficult operating in the dark, but right now I don't think I have any other choice. Excuse me. Put him through here. Commander Riker. I wanted to inform you that we'll be delayed in picking you up at Farpoint Station. I can't say. I'll keep you updated. Will you inform Doctor Crusher and Lieutenant La Forge of our delay? Is there anything else, Counsellor? What about him? I see. Do you think this will interfere with your duties? I appreciate your telling me, but I'm quite sure that the two of you will find some way to deal with the situation. Tea, Earl Grey, hot. There is an alternative, Tomolak. We each know why we're here. We could each send one ship into the Neutral Zone to investigate the anomaly in the Devron System. No. There is no need to make threats. We each know the consequences. Helm, set course for the Devron system, warp five. Engage. All stop. On screen. Full scan, Mister Data. We have to get as much information as possible about that anomaly. All stop. On screen. Then it is larger in the past. Nothing. Full scan, Mister Data. On screen! On screen! Let's see it! I don't understand. It was here in the other two time periods. Why isn't it here now? You're not thinking about leaving? There should be! There has to be! Data, is there some other way to scan for a temporal disturbance? Something that isn't covered in a normal sensor sweep. That's it. Make it so. But six more hours may not be enough. We have to stay here until we find it, no matter how long it takes. Beverly, I cannot believe that you are not willing to stay here until we Damn it, I was just trying to. Look, there are larger concerns here. What you don't understand is that You're right. I was out of line. It won't happen again. But what you have to understand is what is at stake here. Q has said that all of humanity will be destroyed. What? Q? What is going on here? Where is the anomaly? Answer me. What help? My time shifting. The answer does lie there, doesn't it. Now, tell me one thing. This anomaly we're looking for, will that destroy humanity? By doing what? When? How can Report, Mister Data. What is the source of this energy? What if we modified the main deflector to emit an inverse tachyon pulse. That might be able to scan beyond the subspace barrier. That might give us some idea of what the interior of this thing looks like. I have some friends who are quite well versed in it. Make it so. How is this possible? Anti-time? So if time and anti-time were to collide Data, what could have caused this collision of time and anti-time? I believe that if you modify the deflectors to send out an inverse tachyon pulse, then you'll find that the anomaly is a rupture between time and anti-time. I don't have time to discuss it now, Mister Data. Do the modifications and send out the pulse. Then try working on a theory as to what caused this rupture. Mister O'Brien, how large is this anomaly? I don't understand why it's bigger in the past. Lieutenant, you have the Bridge. I'll be in my Ready room. What's going on? Weapons status? We have to stop it! We don't have time for this. The Pasteur's core is going to breach. No, Will, we can't! We have to save humanity. Will, don't leave! We have to stay here and find what is causing the temporal anomaly. We have to! Everything depends on it! We can't leave now! Please, listen to me! How is she? So this is affecting the entire crew. We have to find out how widespread this effect is. Contact Starbase Twenty three, that's the nearest outpost. Have them check their personnel to see if there are any signs of temporal reversion. Mister Data, how close are you to completing the tachyon scan? Good. When it's done I want you to find some way of collapsing this anomaly without making things worse. Give me a risk analysis of whatever solution you come up with. Dismissed. Why? Will that cause the destruction of mankind? Home? Q, is there any point to all this? So the anomaly is here too, at Earth. The further back in time, the larger the anomaly. Are you saying that I caused the anomaly, and that the anomaly somehow disrupted the beginnings of life on Earth? Let's concentrate on how this anomaly was initially formed. Speculation? Is there any way that we can scan the interior? Do you know what could? Data do we have a tomographic imaging scanner on board? Can you use it to scan the interior of the anomaly? What is it? Three pulses, from three time periods, converging at one point in space. Computer, where is Admiral Riker? Ensign. How do I get to Ten Forward? Thank you. Will! Will, I know why it's happening. I know what's causing the anomaly. We have to go back. Damn it Will, I know why it's happening. We caused the anomaly with the tachyon pulse. It happened three times, Will. We did it in three different time periods! Will you leave me alone? Damn it, I'm not stupid. Will, the tachyon pulses, they were used in the same spot in three different time periods. Don't you see? When the tachyon pulse used. I mean, I mean when the Pasteur used the tachyon pulse, then, then, we I mean everything started, Will. We set everything in motion. It's like the chicken and the egg, Will, the chicken and the egg! We think it started in the past but it didn't. It started right here, in the future. That's why it's getting larger in the past. Yes! Right. That's it. Yes. That's why it gets larger in the past. It grows as it travels backwards in time. Go back, Will. We go back to the Devron System. I was right. We must stop it here so it can't travel back through time. The next time I'm there, it's the first thing I'll do. Data, disengage the tachyon pulse. Do it. The convergence of the tachyon pulses from the three time periods is what is causing the anomaly. Is there any change in the anomaly? Disengage the tachyon pulse. I know that. But it is imperative that you disengage the tachyon pulse immediately. Why isn't the anomaly being affected? I've shut off the tachyon pulses in the other time periods but it hasn't changed the anomaly. That could be a problem. The anomaly's so much larger in the other two time periods It may be dangerous to take the ship in. Into the anomaly, Chief. Lay in a course for the exact centre and transfer all available power to the shields. No, Lieutenant, I cannot. I understand your concerns, Lieutenant, and I know if I were in your position I would be doing the same thing. Looking for answers. But you're not going to find any because I don't have any to give you. I know it is difficult for you to understand, but we have to take the ship into the very centre of the phenomenon and create a static warp shell. Now, this will put the ship at risk. Quite frankly, we may not survive. But I want you to believe that I am doing this for a greater purpose, and that what is at stake here is more than any of you can possibly imagine. I know you have your doubts about me, about each other, about the ship. All I can say is that although we have only been together for a short time, I know that you are the finest crew in the fleet and I would trust each of you with my life. So, I am asking you for a leap of faith, and to trust me. Take us in, Chief. A static warp shell. It could repair the barrier and collapse the anomaly. Mister Data, you're a clever man in any time period. Helm, lay in a course for the centre of the anomaly and prepare to initiate a static warp shell. The other two Enterprises, they're on their way. All hands, brace for impact! Maintain course and speed. Mister Data, how long until we reach the centre? Initiate warp shell! No, we have to maintain the static warp shell as long as possible! Transfer emergency power to the antimatter containment system! Maintain position! Mister La Data, report! Are you saying that it worked? We collapsed the anomaly? Did it work? What about my crew? Thank you. You had a hand in helping me get out of this. I sincerely hope that this is the last time that I find myself here. When I realised the paradox. Q, what is it that you're trying to tell me? Mister Worf, what's the date? No. No. No. I think I'll get back to bed. I could use some sleep. No. I, er, I just thought that I might, erm, I might join you this evening. If there's room. Oh, er, thank you, Mister Data. Actually, I used to be quite a card player in my youth, you know. I should have done this a long time ago. So. Five card stud, nothing wild, and the sky's the limit.   \n",
