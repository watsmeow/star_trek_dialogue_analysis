I don't like the look of that. Well, the comment was figurative. I'm expressing concern. Yes Commander. Ah. I have taken the initiative of keeping us at maximum scanning distance in case of  anything threatening out there, Captain. Despite the First Officer's constant need to dismiss my ideas... Really? There is something else out there. Recalibrating sensors. Active scans are being deflected. I'm having trouble locating the source. Ah, wait. I have it. No. Recalibrating. I have it. Object of unknown origin. I'm unable to bring it into focus. As Science Officer, I can provide a far more concrete and in-depth analysis than simply   reading data off a monitor, but considering it's scrambling our optical processors,  how are we going to be able to see it? I will. It's lurking. The scattering field it's emitting suggests intent. BURNHAM> We see something we don't understand and instantly cast judgment? Maybe it's lost.  Maybe it's afraid to show us its whole self. I respectfully recommend we leave it alone. With the high levels of radiation kicking off those binaries, she'll have  20 minutes until her DNA starts to unravel like noodles. It seems a waste of the ship's resources. What will be gained? And here I thought we were doing a deep-space communication relay audit. Oh, on any occasion, Captain. The object is 2,000 kilometres bearing... Captain, there is no signal. The scattering field is still a problem, Captain. We can't transport her until she clears it. Internal sensors show that the Commander has entered the Bridge in an irradiated state.  Without immediate treatment, her condition will most certainly be terminal. She also has a grade-three concussion. If there are Klingons in this sector, we should withdraw immediately. We cannot destroy another culture's property on a whim. Something is scanning us. They've detected our weapons signature. None. Commander, there is something I'd like to show you. Their hull is covered in hollow,  ornamental, metallic pods, thousands of them, tightly interlocked, forming a kind of armour. I suspect its purpose is more symbolic than practical. They contain Klingon biological  material in various states of decay. Remote dating is wildly divergent. Some bones date back  thousands of years, others only hours old. Commander, the Captain listens to you. Tell her we must withdraw. Your world has food chains. Mine does not. Our species map is binary. We are either predator or prey.  My people were hunted, bred, farmed. We are your livestock of old. We were biologically determined  for one purpose and one purpose alone. To sense the coming of death. I sense it coming now. Captain to the Bridge. Aye, Captain. Acoustics are muted. That's the ship's superstructure in sympathetic vibration. Yes, Captain. Where is the Captain? Is the plan to fire on the Klingons, Commander? Are you acting on the Captain's orders? Commander, it's just... your breathing is elevated. Perspiration's visible at your hairline.

Suus Mahna. Captain, what am I doing on this ship? I received no warning that I'd be transferred to another prison facility, which is customary.  Then my shuttle changed course halfway through the journey. Sir? Question is, what am I gonna do with you? If I put you in the brig someone's gonna die,  and I don't have the time for that kind of distraction. You have training in high-level quantum physics,  don't you? My engineers tell me it's gonna take three days to clear the lightning bugs out of the  prisoner shuttle. I have something on deck that requires every trained mind available.  You're gonna help us out. No. No, thank you. Respectfully, I owe a debt for my crime and it'd be best...  I'd prefer to serve my time without getting involved. And what mission is that, sir? Working on what? Why are you nervous? Seriously? No problem. Michael. No, you won't. What's going on? No. Tilly, what the hell is going on on this ship? Saru. Congratulations on your promotion. I understand. The ones in prison don't taste the same. I suppose that is a function of the environment  your eating them in instead of a food synthesiser issue. I suppose so. So many people with so many places to go. So, this is a science vessel. Saru. First Officer Saru. I saw a recording of the speech you gave at the Captain's funeral.  It was beautiful. I never thought I'd get a chance to say this to you. I think about what happened every day.  All the time. And I owe you. I'm trying to say... Yes. I just wanna get back on that shuttle, Commander. I won't make any trouble for you here. I'm looking for Lieutenant Stamets. Starfleet doesn't keep its engineering labs classified. I'm Michael Burnham. I was assigned. Yes. Yes. There may be a misunderstanding. Yes. No. I was raised on Vulcan, and I attended the Vulcan Science Academy. I'm not sure I'm following. I'm struggling with these equations. Initially thought I was dealing with quantum astrophysics.  But as I got deeper in, biochemistry came into play. Maybe even a form of gene expression.  It'd be helpful to know what I'm working on. It's your call. But either way, this line here? It's a mistake. Not really. I understand. It's okay. You're a nice kid, Tilly, but I'm not staying long enough to make friends. Basidiosac? That's an unfamiliar term. Basidia refers to spore-producing structures. The numbers I've been analysing have been  consistent with organic structures. You mentioned the term bloom. That typically refers to  biologicals. I'm trying to get up to speed, so that I can help with this mission. In what is our problem based,  biology or physics? Sir? All right. Lieutenant Stamets, I sincerely have no idea what research you're involved in. I never even intended to be here. What the hell could do this to a dozen fully armed Klingons? Run. In here.

No, he's always pushing us for more. I'm sure that our rate of progress is his  life's biggest disappointment. By the way, 12 is a perfectly robust number, Straal. Where's the Glenn? I hate you. How? I hate you. How? That's not possible. I'm not jealous, oddly. I'm worried. That displacement is too massive. It's not safe. I despise lurkers. Why would I tell a prisoner of the Federation, who is essentially a temp,  the details of my top secret research? You can go, lurker. What happened? Was it a bloom failure? Why not just transport what we need from the Glenn over to us? Shielded? That's curious. Really? We're running drills near Klingon space. Well, Captain, I will need to take a team with me. You know, for the cumbersome,  annoying science part. Sir, it's one thing to make her a data cruncher in my lab, but to integrate her into this  project at such a deep level... Yes, sir. You see the etchings on the hull? That's evidence of catastrophic basidiosac rupture. You're out of your depth here, non-Vulcan number cruncher. Seen and not heard, please. Are you trying to show everyone how smart you are? Are you really so naive as to see them as different? At the quantum level, there is no difference between biology and physics. No difference at all.  And you talk about spores. What are they? They are the progenitors of panspermia.  They are the building blocks of energy across the universe. Physics and biology? No. Physics as biology. I became an astromycologist because of awe. Awe at the miracle of life. I met Straal,  and we formed a partnership. We would get to the veins and muscles that hold our galaxies together.  We would find truth. And we were happy in our lab, then your war started, and Starfleet co-opted our research.  They split us up, put us in charge of different teams, so we could work twice as fast. Not for truth,  or to further Starfleet's mission statement of diplomacy and exploration, but for war.  And now my friend and his colleagues are dead because of our research. And I have to live with that,  but if you think I'm okay handing my life's work over to that warmonger Lorca, you're wrong. Well, if Lorca wants you to be here, I'm afraid your intentions are less than moot. Nothing's normal after an accident like this. I never anticipated injuries like this. Cadet, scan to determine if the  helical trauma to the body is related to the spiral markings on the ship's hull. Engineering is this way. Look. If they do, it's all over. Because they didn't die in the initial accident. They probably boarded after spying  a crippled Federation ship with no lifesigns. They beamed on to steal our tech. Over here. This hull is double-reinforced. What could tear through this metal? To Engineering! Burnham, download the ship's logs. Tilly, pull all telemetry and check the spore-containment status. Oh, God. I'm sorry, my friend. This is coming with us. Help me get it off. Well, we'll take it with us. Can we go now, please? Burnham, we're in the shuttle. What is your location?",45

Eight two allows you to conscript virtually anyone in time of war. This organisation's only convicted mutineer is viewed by many, justifiably or not,  as the cause of our conflict with the Klingons. To see her avoiding justice does nothing for general morale. But why give everyone another reason to judge you? I'm your friend. The pilot was killed in the subsequent firefight. Capitan Lorca was captured by the Klingons. No. By the time we responded to the shuttle's distress beacon,  the enemy's warp trail had dissipated. Since you're Acting Captain, I'm sending you what little intel we have.  This was a targeted abduction. It's possible the Klingons have learned of the existence of  Discovery's propulsion system, and taken Lorca to learn more.We need him back, Mister Saru,  before they pry those secrets out of him. Good luck.",14

Six point five. And yes, they matter, if you're ever gonna make Captain. Everyone applying to the Command Training Programme will be smart. Personality doesn't count. Six point five seconds is not an arbitrary number. Your new time will earn you a  physical endurance commendation. Today, your goal is six point five seconds. Then,  getting a transfer on a Constitution-class, like the Enterprise. After that,  First Officer track. See your path, stay on it, reach your destination. Cadet to Captain, just like that.  What's it going to be, Tilly? Computer, cancel that order. That's hardly the correct ratio of protein, carbohydrates, and fat.  Computer, three egg white breakfast burrito with black beans. Make it two. Computer, add roasted tomato salsa. Cooked tomatoes are a great source of lycopene. Remember that. Six? I've fought Klingons. I doubt it. I can't imagine Captain Lorca feeling that way about anyone. The same. You probably can believe everything you hear. I should go. Yes. No. Sarek. You brought me here. Sarek! Sarek. It's not me, it's Sarek. He's in trouble. I share part of his katra, his eternal life force. I was raised as one. After my parents were killed at a Vulcan outpost He believed I could serve as humanity's potential. But not everyone agreed with him. A group of logic extremists, they didn't want humans in their culture.  They tried to stop him by killing me. They bombed the Learning Centre where I was educated. Renegade Vulcans, a small faction. And they didn't try, Doctor, they succeeded.  I was dead for three minutes. The katra has a healing power and Sarek used it to save me. A kind of soul graft.  It's a procedure that's frowned upon, and rare. Once. The start of the war. He sensed my distress and came to me. But this is different.  I can feel him slipping away. I don't think this is a conscious effort on his part. Sarek is delirious.  He might be dying. Captain, please. Captain, help me find him. I still sense Sarek, but it's growing erratic. I think he's getting worse. Me. I'm guessing from your reaction that modifying this neural enhancer is a viable method  to achieve what I need. I can sense that Sarek is unconscious. I want to use this mind-meld to wake him up  so he can activate his ship's transponder. I was thinking adrenaline shot, but okay. Okay, so we go in with a shuttle. As long as I don't overstay my welcome, the shuttle shields can handle it, but I need  someone to work the neural enhancer. I'd like Cadet Tilly. She's smart, and I could use the moral support. You know where Sarek's mind is? Where his dying thoughts have taken him? To me. No. No, you don't understand. I was supposed to be his proof that humans and Vulcans could  coexist as equals, but I ended up being his greatest disappointment. That's what he's reflecting on.  I was rejected from the Expeditionary Group for being too human. My failure is his last thought.  He doesn't believe in me, but I'm supposed to save him. They will. Sarek is delirious. I can't allow him to push me like that out again.  But fighting him is gonna put a massive strain on me. Don't. No matter what the sensors say, you leave me in there. Okay? Go. I'm sorry, Sarek. You were wrong to believe in me. Why are you doing this? You called me here. Your katra pulled me. You're near death. I can help you like you helped me. Give me a chance. Please. No, you're not. I said I'm not leaving here without Sarek. Sarek keeps blocking me. I can't fight you, too. I don't know. His thoughts are fixed on my graduation day, but the emotions from that memory  are too difficult for me to handle. I'm going back in. Sarek. What are you hiding? What don't you want me to see?  Is it really worth dying over? I can save you, Sarek, but you have to let me into your mind. Let me in. You had faith in me once. I'm asking you to have faith in me again. You chose Spock over me, didn't you? You were forced into that decision.  Why not tell me the truth? Instead, you made me believe I failed you. You manipulated me. Do you have any idea what  living with that lie did to me? Shame? Show me how to save you like you saved me. My thoughts to your thoughts. Wake up, Sarek. Tell us where you are. He'll live, but Doctor Culber says he can't meet the Klingons in this condition.  The window for the talks closes in a few hours. Even if the Federation wanted to step in,  they couldn't get there in time. Much as it would displease my Vulcan mentor, I'm feeling a lot of emotions right now. I'm not sure pride is one of them.

You know, these are the moments that make life so gloriously unpredictable. You're a very tall man. May I say you are astonishingly grounded for having endured seven months of torture. Speaking of different, look at the cybernetic augment that my resident genius here built for me. You're always looking out for me. By the way, what's the deal with you two? What did he mean by that? What did you mean by that? Oh, Tyler. Tyler, wait! Yeah. Burnham, both of you. You need to listen to me. There isn't any time. I.. Or rather, there is time, too much time. I can't slow down! Don't you see what's happening? We have been here before. All of us.  I cannot be the only person who recognises this. What I need is for all of you placid people to finally start listening. Wait! Wait!  Er, it all starts with a gormagander, okay? A gormagander. As days go, this is a weird one. I know, believe me. We've been through all this before. Multiple times, actually. And I hate to tell you,  but I have yet to find a way where it ends with a win for the home team. I'll see you again soon. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey. Where's Burnham? Burnham, don't talk, just listen. The ship is in danger. We are caught in a temporal loop. We are repeating the same thirty odd minutes over and over again. The ship can be destroyed,  we can all be killed, but as long as the thirty minute window doesn't expire, everything starts over.  And every second that you doubt me brings us all closer to death. Do you understand? Yes, yes, yes. Please stop talking and come with me. I'll explain everything. Mudd is using some kind of technology that allows him to repeat the same thirty minutes over and over.  He's trying to get the spore drive running so he can sell the ship to the Klingons. Well, the Tardigrade is a multidimensional creature, so it must be a side effect of  combining its DNA with mine. Yes. And it's getting really hard to keep it straight. I can't stop Mudd alone, Burnham.  And sooner or later, he's going to figure out there's a piece missing from the spore drive. It's me. I don't know. I'm hoping maybe Tyler might, because they shared a cell together.  Tyler mentioned it right before I shot Mudd. Anyway, I need you to talk to Tyler. We're almost out of time in this loop. Tell me a secret. Something that will immediately prove to you we've had this conversation.  Something you've never admitted to anyone. I promise it'll be safe with me. I'm sorry. Now is usually around the time he kills the Captain. I just spotted the hottest guy over there, and apparently he's in a band. Have fun. You've never been in love. Because I need your help. - You told me that piece of information to prove to you that what  I'm saying is true. We have been caught in a 30-minute time loop and I'm the only one who realises it.

And we particularly enjoy being discussed in the third person while present. But you are accurate. I possess visual, auditory, and tactile receptors more acute than yours,  which is why I am being tortured by this planet's constant noise, and you are not. Keep this pointed at the ground. Greetings. We are explorers from the Federation Starship Discovery.  We come in peace. I believe it wants us to accompany it. I don't think they mean us any harm. If their intentions were nefarious, I would be the first to sense a threat.  We need to establish communication. I am Commander Saru.  As a First Contact specialist, I would like permission to analyse the sound you are emitting to  determine if it is a form of language. It was not painful, just disorienting. I believe I felt their intentions, their desire to converse.  This will take some time. We are still establishing a vocabulary. So, not very far. They are the planet. Everywhere you go, you can feel the symbiosis between nature and the living spirit.  Amazing to think that while we fight our war, a place of peace and harmony not only survives, it thrives. I can't be sure, but they desperately want to know others and to be known, and have been  trying to share who they are with the rest of the universe since since the beginning of their existence. It's the constant noise generated by this planet. It's better when I'm with our Pahvan friend, but  still, it is ubiquitous. Well, I sincerely hope so. For now, I think it would be best to call it a night. Can you please make it stop? Even for a moment? We were biologically determined for one purpose and one purpose alone. I sense the coming of death.  I sense it coming now. We have come to Pahvo for your help. We have come to end this war. I'm so afraid.  So afraid. I am, thank you. I just apprised the Captain of our new circumstances. Oh, a simple modification. I altered the frequency of my communicator, linking it to  the planet's transmitter. It boosted the signal sufficiently. The Pahvans are incredibly hospitable. They will grant us anything we want. Some parameters of the mission have changed. I require your communicators. Thank you so very much. Oh, do not be alarmed. These are no longer necessary. The Pahvans have invited us to  remain here with them. In time, you will experience this world as I do.

There will be no synthetic protein rations tonight, Lieutenant. Where's Burnham? I am sorry. But soon you will know what it means to exist without conflict. I'm going to find Burnham.  She must be starving. I believe I was the problem. I did not understand what I was perceiving. I was not yet in harmony.  The Pahvans helped me.

Mister Saru, while we get up to speed  with this universe, see to it that the ship, the crew and its Captain are prepared. I mean fully prepared. To successfully crash a party, you have to look like you belong. You must project confidence. Every detail of this so-called Terran Empire must be replicated exactly. And wherever we may fall short, we have to get creative. Our very survival relies on our ability to maintain this cover, no matter what.  We are now the ISS Discovery. Are we civilians? Do we get uniforms? What? Where are we? What happened? And my crew... they alive? Well, there's me hoping I'd find a better version of myself over here. Look out there. Come on.  Amazing, isn't it? A different universe, but somehow the same people had a way to find each other.  The strongest argument I've ever seen for the existence of destiny. Well, is that so? Sitting in that cell all alone, facing a life sentence of solitude,  future full of misery. A little part of you had to know that wasn't the end of your story.  You were destined for something more. Well, let's agree to disagree for now. So, who is this Emperor? Maybe it's not a bad thing that you and I are ghosts. I found something curious in the data here.  A potential way home. Now, I didn't know how to exploit it till right now, but I think you might end up  saving us all. Data from rebel intelligence suggests that we're not the first ship from our universe to find  ourselves here. It cites another Starfleet vessel. USS Defiant. Regardless, the Defiant is a Constitution class vessel. It didn't get here by spore drive.  If we find out how it did make it over, could be our way home. Intel on the Defiant is classified. It's only available on a Terran ship to those  with high-level clearance, like a captain. I'm responsible for her death, and I'm still at large, so Captain Burnham will be  returning to the Shenzhou with me as bounty. We beam over, Burnham gets the info on Defiant, we beam back. Simple. Every Captain in the  Empire has a personal guard. You're gonna be Burnham's. Have long-range sensors scan for the ISS Shenzhou. When you find her, plot an intercept course.  Let's get us home. Impressive. No. Not here. Here, it's just right. You know him? Showtime. Gonna look after her. Mister Saru, you're in charge now. Well, I guess you're in charge  to anybody off the ship, Captain Killy. Maintain a safe distance. Close enough to transport us  back as soon as Burnham gets her hands on the Defiant files. I know you won't. Tyler, where were you? What? No more apologies. From now on, we're Terrans. Decency is weakness. It will get us killed.  And the lives of everyone on this ship and in the Federation are at stake. So you do what you must.  Whatever you must. To anyone. Understand? Guess that's the last time you're calling me Captain. Hopefully, just for a while. You ready? Energise.",80

And that's you. You're my tether.  You bring me back. You did it before we were stranded in this place, and you're still doing it now. Think about this. You're gonna get yourself killed. Why can't we see anything? They have us pinned down. Remain Klingon or die! Michael, please. The captain warned us that we'd do things out of our nature to survive. Stop. Please, please stop. I feel something for her. L'Rell. A reverence, an allegiance, maybe an affection.  And when she speaks, I'm forced to listen. And her words, they tell me who I am. Kahless. More than that. More than just mind games. More than torture! They reduced a Klingon body to human. I don't... I don't think I'm Ash Tyler, Starfleet Lieutenant.  Not really. Not anymore. I feel him inside me. His thoughts, his pain, his rage. I tried to shut her out when L'Rell spoke the call. I resisted by thinking of you, the one  I want to be human for. The one I love. I tried, Michael. But then I saw him, face to face,  down on that planet, and I couldn't fight it anymore. I remember now. I remember it all. We needed to infiltrate your ship, learn your secrets. You were willing to betray your Captain to  protect your people. I sacrificed my body and mind to protect mine. I have the human's face,  but inside I remain Klingon. I remain Voq, Son of none. The torchbearer. Doctor Culber saw past this feeble body into the heart and mind of a warrior, which is why I killed him. A necessary casualty. You. You killed my lord. And you fought like a coward. Scratched at my eyes. But you could not blind me to the truth. I failed T'Kuvma that day. I won't fail him again. I end you in T'Kuvma's name. Kahless, give me light to see forever.

And once we're in position within the cave system, we'll release our surveillance drone  to collect the necessary tactical information. Thank you, Admiral. What evolving details? I'm fine, Sarek. He... I don't know what he was. I've made foolish choices. Emotional choices. Admiral Cornwell requested a status report. I just said goodbye to my father, and it felt different. Final. It won't be, right? Death found me when I was a child. So, yeah, I knew what I was getting into. It makes you optimistic. I'm told he's doing well. He killed a Starfleet officer, and he he tried to kill me. I do. That does not mean I should. I don't know where to start. I believe you. Was there ever really an Ash Tyler? And did he love me? Because I loved him.  You lied to me. You said that if it got to be too much, that if you couldn't handle it, you would come to me.  And it did. And you didn't. And that wasn't Voq, that was you. Tyler. Excuse? Stop. Maybe you're right. I know in my head that you couldn't be responsible for Voq's actions,  but I felt your hands around my neck. And I looked into your eyes and I saw how much you wanted to kill me.  The man that I love wanted me dead. And no matter how hard I try, when I look at you now, I see Voq's eyes. I see him. Your crew may have put it behind them, but I can't. We created something beautiful today in a desolate wasteland that had never seen life.  After the Battle of the Binary Stars I was so lost. I had to sit with myself. I had to work through it.  I had to crawl my way back. I'm still not there, but I'm trying. That kind of work, reclaiming life,  it's punishing and it's relentless. And it's solitary. Ash. It's not easy letting you go. Yes, Captain.",48

Live sacrifices were thrown in  to honour Molor. When Kahless defeated Molor, those temples were abandoned, built over.  The ones that remained were shielded to make them impossible to find with sensors.  You'll have to transport down there and do the legwork yourself. The land was given to the Orions, who built an embassy outpost over the ruins. No. Captain. No. You gonna be okay down there? Exactly. The Orions here aren't likely to trust us or give up any information. It's a space whale. Maybe these guys can lead us to the shrine. The game is called t'Sang. It translates to obliterate them. I think I do. And I think I'm good at it. I mean, Voq was good at it. He was a decent gambler.  He felt the numbers always fell his way, as if the universe was making up for his bad luck with  everything else. He was born with a rare mutation that made his skin translucent white. The others considered  him a freak of nature. No, I'm looking to take a few hundred darseks from losers like you. Let's  begin your humiliation. Out of my way. Croupier. New player goes first. Two! Two! Victory! Destroy him! Two! Victory! Owned! I got nothing. None of them know about an ancient shrine. A human speaking Klingon is amusing to them. Might as well be a dog on waterskis. No, I... I just made it up. I like to waterski. You raced out of there pretty quick. You all right? No. I mean, I've heard things. I never wanted to push. How could you not hate them? And me, for what I've become? I can see both sides. Literally. The side I've chosen is where you stand, where it's  possible to feel compassion and sympathy for your enemy. But I can guarantee no Klingon ever felt  that way toward you. You see that? Pouring an extra drink. Setting it on fire. That's a step specific to the  followers of Molor. There's a decent chance they know about that shrine. I know where to find the shrine. What's wrong? A hydro bomb? What kind of damage can it do? You once told Voq that you didn't want the mantle of leadership. Isik for your thoughts. L'Rell has arranged for a transport to a Makai ship. It's not the human way to make a message heard, but it's the Klingon way. I'm going with her.  It's true, what the Emperor said. I'm no good for either side. I... But maybe I can be good for both.  I've never been great at goodbyes. Michael. In spite of everything that happened to you, your capacity to love literally saved my life.  I'm gonna miss looking at you. Thank... thank you.",32

We have always looked to the  stars to discover who we are. A thousand centuries ago in Africa, the Kaaba Em Abathwa tribe  gathered to share a story. The tale of a girl who dug her hands in the wood ash and threw it into the  sky to create the Milky Way. And hidden there, a secret, buried among the eternal stars, was a message. An enormous letter in a bottle made of space and time, visible only to those whose hearts were open  enough to receive it. Michael. When I first heard the story of the girl who made the stars, I wasn't ready to understand.  I still don't know if I am. Hello. Except for life support. Scans show 203 crew members aboard. The vessel's entire complement is alive. Yes, sir. Neither had I. Foster brother. I'm fine, Saru. We received a priority alert from one of Starfleet's most prominent ships. I am on mission  and in problem-solving mode. That's what you're sensing. Do you have any siblings? I know the feeling. Very colourful. Like a compass at the North Pole. I believe it's a simile. Burnham. Michael Burnham. Yes, I'm aware. Mister Spock. I was expecting to see him. Linus. You okay? You look a little... Yes. I hear it's going around. Home. To Earth. Door. Yes, of course. Or they never die at all. I wasn't aware you knew Amanda read Alice to me. Do you think they're related? Could the Klingons be involved? Why do you think he didn't come on board? There's more to it than that. How long has it been since you spoke to him? Me too. When I first came to you, I... I know that you considered every possible effect a  Vulcan education, a Vulcan life, might have on a human child. What did you want Spock to learn from me? Wouldn't he have learned this from our mother? Fill up the room. So from a peer, a sibling, you thought He may have. For a time. Father, I am confident that empathy is very real for Spock. Thank you. All sensors are at maximum power. There's no sign of the original signal or any object  that might have generated it. Sir, the point of near impact was the exact coordinates of the signal. There's interference from a hyper-dense cloud of charged particles. This rock has an atmosphere. Discovery has telescopic cameras to help aid in hull repairs. We point them at the asteroid and  capture images. Images are coming in, but closer is better. There's a Starfleet vessel down there. I picked up a strange chasm cutting across the ice field of the asteroid's surface. There's no way to zoom in any further. Commander Saru, I know your vision has a larger  optical window than ours. Can you make out the registry number? Still impossible to scan, sir. Negative. The cloud of charged particles will disrupt transporter signals. Without pattern enhancers,  transport to and from the asteroid is too dangerous. Landing on an asteroid travelling at five thousand kilometres per second with spotty telemetry  and no transporter Yes. I have one. That's what I was trying to offer. And for the record, there is not a single  person on this bridge who would abandon a Starfleet brother or sister, sir. We have less than two hours to fly down to the asteroid's surface and search for survivors,  then set up pattern enhancers and beam back. I'm not uncomfortable with risk. Stamets must be having a field day. I'm coming back, Tilly. These lander pods were developed for a mission to Kim-Tara. It has similar gravimetric conditions. Yes, sir. I was one of the test pilots. Nine Gs for eleven minutes. Copy that. For some of us, maybe. Bridge Launch sequence confirm. We got debris. I'm not detecting any pattern to these energy field detonations. These pods are built for this, Nhan. Just take the stick manually. Connolly, your field is too wide. Watch the boulders in lateral grid six. Connolly, I'm telling you your field is too wide! You can't rely on sensors! No! Discovery,can you activate the captain's ejector seat remotely? Not if I can catch him. I'm comfortable with the risk, sir. You need to trust us, sir. I told you, we don't abandon each other. Discovery has you.  We have him, right, ladies? Calculating the burn rate to stop terminal velocity. Once I eject, take control of my thruster and plot a trajectory to the captain. Nhan, stay on course to the asteroid's surface. You'll be fine. I'm going after the captain. Copy. Get ready to eject the Captain on my mark. On three. One. Discovery, this is Burnham. We have touchdown. There's a ton of interference. Tilly was right. The asteroid's energy density is off the charts.  We need to get her a sample for analysis. Titanium snapped in half. The gravitational field was probably ten times stronger when they landed.  I have an incoming target. It's made from scavenged Starfleet tech. Inertial dampeners, too. This design is How long have you...? There was an armistice. We're at peace. Yes. Commander, you kept all of these officers alive by yourself? This asteroid is on a collision course with a pulsar. The gravitational field is gonna tear  this place apart. We're damn sure gonna try. The pads are still intact. Can we move your patients? Set up the enhancers around the ship, widest perimeter possible, then meet us at sickbay. We're in business. The enhancers are just a backup in case the Hiawatha's main transporter doesn't stay online.  Ship-to-ship beaming on the pads is far more reliable, and it'll be safer for your patients.  See if you can get that one up. Once the perimeter's set, we can start beaming them out six at a time. Rerouting power. Discovery,if you can hear me, track my signal. Helmet! Yeah. Wait! Oh. Femoral shaft fracture. Doctor Pollard said I'd be up on my feet in two hours. Tilly, I... I had it, in my hand. But when I beamed out, the transporter didn't get a lock. Right. It would explain the volatile gravitational energy. Get that sample before it's swallowed up by that pulsar. Now, the asteroid has been shedding  rocks all over the place. I mapped several of their trajectories. We still have time to reach one of them. I'm a terrible patient. Sixty seven minutes until vaporisation. Go. Doctor Pollard is the definition of meticulous. I heard you were staying on with us. Does Commander Saru know? They don't. Lorca wasn't one to encourage discourse. Yes, sir. Has Spock told you why he and I don't have a relationship? I'm the reason. I'd like to go to Enterprise, sir. To see him. Even if they had called you back, you were so far away, you wouldn't have made it in time.  Starfleet ordered you to stay away for a reason. Enterprise was an instrument of last resort. And you have no idea what it might have been? How long will he be gone? I'd still like to go aboard.

Oh my God, they took her. Tilly?', 'No!']","We should give it a name. Other than May. I know it looks like a blob, but this is one  of the most sophisticated lifeforms I've ever encountered. It has sentience, intention.  Tilly, the mycelial network doesn't just connect life, it contains it. It's an incubator. I'm certain you were much kinder than you give yourself credit for. You always are. The spore drive will be ready, sir. Bring the drive online, and then we'll couple the shunts to me,  in case we've got to skedaddle. Can I help you? A farmer. Oh please, let us know what you think, because we care. Why soar when you can crawl? Spores are clean, renewable. Do you have any idea how many planets have been ruined by dilithium mining?  How many battles were fought to corner its supply? Of course you don't. You're one of those  people who never even consider it. You know, it was only a couple centuries ago that the Earth nearly choked to death on pollution.  Then we all woke up, and within a generation, everything from a truck to a toaster... Was covered in solar panels. Yesterday's solar panels are today's fungi. What, a giant entity from our universe and a mycelial species from the network?  Well, they have as much in common as me and that grease monkey. We've still got our life support. You know, a gas could, once it ionises. I infuse the spores with an argon-xenon mixture to slow decay.  We could link up the canisters to contain the gas. Our version of a lightning rod. It's my version of the house dressing, but it saves your life. Gas transference at one hundred percent. Are you okay? Okey-doke. Wait. It's gone. Tilly! The mycelial entity has attached itself to Tilly. We're trying to free her. Engineering to bridge. Engineering to bridge. Come in. Comms are down. Are you able to see May again? How do you know this is benign? Did you ever think she was manipulating you? The blob seems to be secreting a psilocybin hallucinogen to influence her emotions. Or maybe it's just trying to calm her down so she won't be scared. The doors won't open, and that thing reattached itself to Tilly. Bad idea. If it's a symbiote, removing it might kill her. No. With the systems fluctuating, this section is partitioned off. We can't get to the warp core. That blob is sending her in and out of consciousness. Actually, we can. This is a harmonic interface. It... it links my neurons to the mycelial network.  With modification, it could link May to Tilly's central nervous system. Let May speak using Tilly's mouth. We're gonna talk to it. We need it to tell us what it wants. We got her. May? What, you're talking about trepanation? Are you gonna fix her up with duct tape after? Then we do this together. No. We're gonna do this old-school. We need to sterilise that drill bit. First aid kit's over there. Well, I'll be. An amplified cortical implant. Hey, kiddo. What's your favorite song? Your favorite song. Sing it for me. Tell my wife I love her very much. May? What do you want? Who are you? So, you came for help to rid your species of a destructive alien presence? The... the... the jumps? Discovery's jumps? Risk? You infected my friend. You don't belong inside of her. Oh, I can only ask for your forgiveness. I knew better. I know better. I'll do whatever  it takes to fix this. All I ask is that you let Tilly go. No! Tilly! Hand me the damn torch. Tilly. Breathe. Breathe, Tilly. Breathe. Breathe, breathe. Slow it down. Breathe. Come on, you're okay. You're still you. Slowly. Stamets to Burnham. We got Tilly. She's okay. We need to close the door to the network, forever. Just making final calculations. Er, you might still be coming down off your hallucinogen. Wow. Have you always been a superior being? Because the harmonics in your aura... It's on yours, too. Yours, too. That tastes like... It dosed us. It dosed us. Slap me really hard. To get me focused enough to find the med kit. I need to hit us both with a shot of impedrizine  so we can come down. Now I need to give one to Tilly.

I do not understand why,  but I am beginning to think that the sphere is... is triggering the Kelpien biological process  known as Vahar'ai. It is the event that signals when Kelpiens are ready to be culled for slaughter  by the Ba'ul, the predator species on my homeworld of Kaminar. It does not matter. Kelpien ganglia only enflame in this manner as we near our end. I am a...  a slave to my biology. There is not. Kelpiens undergoing Vahar'ai either die in the culling or are driven to  madness by the effects of Vahar'ai. Either way, death is inevitable. There may be a way to slow the virus. If we can analyse its properties,  we may be able to develop digital antibodies. In theory. But it will be a slow process, like army ants eating a water buffalo. You will need my help. I am dying, Captain but I am most certainly not dead. The antibodies are slowing the virus's progress. Life support at forty seven percent.  You are wondering why I kept this from you. How do I explain to the woman who has fought over and over for the right to take her next breath,  that I come from a race that submits? Well, to my shame, hiding is my nature. I have learned multiple languages, yet never shared my own,  fearful of revealing my own alienness. May I request a favour? I have kept detailed personal logs since joining Starfleet. I would ask you to officially catalogue them,  so that when General Order One no longer applies to the Kelpiens, they will know a journey like mine  is possible. You might say my life began when I was granted refugee status by the Federation.  While being processed at Starbase Seven, I saw for the first time lifeforms from across the universe,  some with less than I had, yet, with a dream of something better. I listened.  Every story I heard created a space inside me to feel more, to love more. I joined Starfleet to  help those in need the way I was helped. There was just one painful caveat to my signing up. I could never return home. Oh. More flashes of ultraviolet light. They are growing in strength and frequency. No. No. I will be fine. The captain asked you to return to the bridge as soon as possible.  I can continue the work here. Yeah. Yes, of course. I've been so blind. The ultraviolet wavelengths are repeating,  like... like letters would in in a sentence everywhere. No, no. No. You called me an empathic soul, and it is true. My ganglia respond to shifts  in my environment, like an early-warning system. So it is... it is no coincidence that  I started feeling sick just before the sphere engaged us. I know what it is trying to say. Not first contact, Burnham. Last contact. I think it came to us to die. Captain, hold your fire. I do not believe the sphere means us any harm. Captain, what if Vahar'ai, my death process, was triggered because the sphere is also dying? We Kelpiens have a defining trait hard-wired into our DNA. Empathy. I can feel the sphere  reaching out, trying to share something before it expires. Captain, I believe I have discerned its means of communication. What if the sphere was not attacking our universal translator, but attempting to teach us its  language because it wants to be remembered, to preserve its history using Discovery,  but it cannot unless we power down and let it in? Computer, adjust view screen display to ultraviolet. That is the light pattern I have been  seeing everywhere, repeating again and again, generated by the sphere's virus.  Computer, run the light pattern through the universal translator. Captain, I believe we are  looking at a multitude of languages so advanced, and knowledge so vast that it simply overloaded our system. A sign of core collapse. Captain, if we are correct, once the transmission is complete,  the sphere can die knowing that it will live on after it is gone. We can choose to fulfill our  part in its destiny, or simply let it fade away unremembered. Lieutenant Detmer, lower shields. Bryce, all channels open. Owosekun, divert all computing resources to Communications. Ah. It is so beautiful. The light is almost like music. Now it is my turn. Take me to my quarters, please. I left home with a handful of seeds. It is the blossom that marks the the passing of seasons on Kaminar. Somewhere along the way,  I lost who I was. So focused on being the best Kelpien in Starfleet. Defined by my rank and uniform  until that is all I became. It is time. In that first drawer, you will find a Kelpien knife, a keepsake I use to prune my flowers.  I need you to... to sever my ganglia and end my suffering. I need your help so that I can die now,  peacefully, before the pain and madness overtakes me. Thank you, Michael. I am sorry. I know how hard this is for you. How many people you have already lost.  I would do it myself, but I am too weak. I feel the same about you. You are the only one who knows me. You replaced the sister I had on Kaminar.  Siranna. That knife was hers. I left her without so much as a goodbye. You promise me, no matter how  frightening or painful it may be, promise me you will mend your relationship with Spock.  If you and I can build this type of bond, I'm certain you can do the same with him. Please. Goodbye, Michael. Michael? What is wrong? I... I... don't understand. I should be I have never felt this way before. Fear has always been the governing principle of my life.  But now, it is gone. More than that, I feel power. My own power. Despite speaking ninety four languages, there are times when words are not enough. A new and deeply troubling one. The Kelpien way of life has always been oriented toward  death and the role the Ba'ul play in it. My people call it The Great Balance. It is our central,  organising truth. Precisely. And you asked me before why I could not go home. It is because I made a promise to  Captain Georgiou to uphold General Order One, not to interfere with the destiny of my species.  But now, knowing that what my people have accepted as the truth is a lie, what does this mean for us?  For my species? My... my planet?",57

Captain, every decision you've made so far is about your guilt at sitting out the war. You're trying to prove your bravery at the expense of our lives. Initiating plasma burn, sir. Plasma levels at 30%, shields down to 23. So you got what you came for. Dire straits, high stakes. Low probability of surfacing. And the bonus of taking me down with you. What is that? Engaging external shielding. It's trying to find a way in. Some of the metals in this thing don't even register on the periodic chart.  And atomic decay measurements indicate the probe's core has aged five hundred years. Yeah. No! On Qo'noS, we wouldn't even bother to bandage it. Just instinct. Your plasma burn was the right call, sir. Like you said, you were the most qualified. Whether the Red Angel is here to end something or start something, one thing's for sure.

Our destination is the Talos star group. Are you real? Is there any way I can keep them from probing my mind, from using my thoughts against me? Let's get back to the ship. Personal log, Captain Christopher Pike. Stardate 1532.9. Still no word from Commander Burnham,  but I know she won't give up until she finds her brother Spock. As much as it pains me to think the  worst of any Starfleet division, I do hope she locates him before Section 31 does. Are you sure Commander Burnham received the hails from your ship and that she deliberately ignored them? Who also happens to be her brother. There are many different approaches here.  The Discovery can be a more valuable asset. All right. My tolerance for discretion has worn very thin. What exactly is your relationship with  Michael Burnham? And has that always been the case? Mister Tyler, you and I have been through a lot together recently.  I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt, and I'm asking that you do the same with me. I apologise, Mister Tyler, but I'm responsible for a lot of lives here. Your feelings could impact our mission. That's more than I thought. All right, start with the Quiliam Station in Beta Quadrant  and work your way around. And we are. The crew's on task. Ensign Tilly, care to bring Specialist Tyler up to speed on our  probe search? We don't know. Point is, we're doing our job. If Section 31 wants us to stay stationary, so be it,  but I won't ignore a crisis involving my officers. Mister Tyler, this is my ship. More importantly, this is my crew. I will not call off the search.  I will not leave two of them out there. Certainly not when one is accused of crimes I don't believe he committed. I can believe that about you. Not about Spock. Do you think you're surprising me with this information? What are you saying? If you trust Burnham more than Section 31, why are you working for them? Walk with me. An unauthorised transmission? Where? Not just anyone can access that array. There must be some trace of the sender. You allowed the fight to proceed? But hardly an example of by-the-book conflict resolution. Then, occasionally, we have to make it up as we go along. This is not intended with any judgment, Mister Saru, but I suspect that, before your own evolution,  you might have made a different call. Given the unusual nature of our circumstances, I'm going to overlook the incident,  but this can't happen again. And please make sure everyone's aware that we will not be settling our  differences with violence, but with the uniform code of contact. And that goes for you as well. Good. Vina. Here. How? Used to me? I've thought about you, us, often, and wished that you would have come with me. I'm glad. I'm glad you're not alone. You didn't deceive anyone, Vina. I felt it, too. But you're here now? This is real? Burnham. You're on Talos? Can you see me? I know what happened. Georgiou reported that she tried to hail your shuttle while Spock was on  board and you failed to respond. But why? What do they want with Spock? Spock, it is good to see you. What design? Engineering, status, please. Talos Four. Yes, it is. Hit it, Airiam. What's going on down there? Have there been previous corruption issues with the hub? We have to get to Talos IV to retrieve Spock and Burnham. But our spore drive has conveniently gone down,  and it wasn't an accident. I've recently learned that Section 31 has accessed invasive neurologic tech. Maybe they used it on you. I'm sorry, Tyler. I can't afford to take your word for it. And neither can you. Have him confined to his quarters until further notice. Thank you, Mister Tyler. I agree. Set a course for Starbase 11 at maximum warp. Radio ahead. Say that we need repairs. Maybe that'll throw off any potential pursuers. Exactly why I want Section 31 to think that we're going there. We'll pick a point midway,  alter course and then run silent. That should buy use enough time. I hope. Tyler's confined. They didn't find us through him. Answer them, Bryce. I'll start following orders when you start telling the truth. Or did you not think I'd find  out what you were going to do to Spock? Detmer, drop us in over Talos Four. Owo, the second we're in range, start scanning for our people. Beam them up, quickly. Put him on. I can't do that. Mute screen. Goodbye, Vina. Owo, disengage transporter. No. They wouldn't want to risk answering. Let them in the shuttlebay. Mister Saru, with me. Talosian projection. That's how. Spock. Are you all right? Is that a smile I see on your face? Well, welcome to Discovery. Spock, I need to hear about this Red Angel. Do you know what it is? And what is that outcome? By what? Well, we should sure alter course and get the hell out of here. In just a few minutes... I don't suppose the Red Angel offered you any advice on how to handle a situation like this. And what is that? I can't ask any of you to participate in what is clearly an act of disobedience. Helm, get us out of here.",71

I don't think anyone tracked me here. Wish it were under better circumstances, Mister Saru. I have, but before we get into any of that, I need to speak privately with Mister Spock. I'm aware of the accusations. You have no idea what I'm thinking. Where's Spock? Beginning cerebral mapping. Try not to move. Okay, let's begin. State your rank, position and assignment. Lieutenant Spock, do you intend to be truthful with me today? Good. Did you recently leave a psychiatric facility without permission? When you left, did you murder Starfleet personnel in the process? Did you kill them in self-defense? Can you explain to me why you did kill them? How did you escape the psychiatric facility, if not with violence? You committed yourself to the facility. Why escape at all? Do you have any idea why the Red Angel chose you to receive these visions? Any idea what they mean? And when you say the end of all sentient life, you mean...? Well, perhaps you're defending him because you're his sister. He's telling the truth about the murders. Or he believes he is. The test is one hundred percent accurate. But so is this. I verified the source codes. The images come straight from Psych.  The admirals who run Section 31 haven't responded to me in weeks.  Their threat assessment system, Control, isn't accepting my data input codes anymore. Admiral Patar. She's a logic extremist. Frankly, I find her fanaticism worrying.  Once the signals appeared, she started lobbying Starfleet to turn its decision-making entirely over to Control. Control is a great resource. Every Starfleet admiral feeds data into it. We consider its recommendations.  But final decisions always include our experience and instinct. Control is located within Section 31's forward operating base.  We need to go there, arrest Patar, and reset the system to take our input as it always has. We rely on Control for all of our critical strategic decisions. If it's in the hands of extremists,  the entire Federation is in danger. It's not abandoned. That's Section 31 headquarters. Where is Mister Tyler, by the way? Sooner we get there, the better. Okay. Welcome to Section 31 headquarters. Zoom in, please. As you can see, it is heavily  fortified on all sides. They are. The Federation didn't build them. We were under attack by Klingon warships with cloaking abilities. Sometimes in war,  the terrible choice is the only choice. You sat out the war because if we'd lost to the Klingons, we wanted the best of Starfleet to survive.  And as this conversation makes clear, that was you and all you represent. You're welcome. Now will you get off my ass so we can get back to work? They must be too busy planning the welcome party. I wouldn't risk it otherwise. No. My mission, your ship. Lieutenant Detmer, sending the route to you now.  One other thing I should mention. The shields will have to be down. The mines are attracted to them. That shouldn't even be possible. Someone reprogrammed the mines.  I can't shut them off. Those are blackout mines. They interfere with navigation. It is, Lieutenant. You're flying blind, just like in the Academy. Pi Alpha Two. And now we're sitting ducks. Why the hell are you attacking a Federation starship? If you think you're coming to arrest us, think again. I understand this is more than you bargained for, but you cannot abandon the mission, Chris.  Whether I can issue orders or not, we have to get a team onto that station and reset Control. I haven't been on the site since before the war. Your guess is as good as mine. Probably better. Then why would it allow us to send a team onto the station? It must want something from us. Why would Control want AI data?",47

So it would have been designed to prevent such scans from working. I'll do what I can, sir. I'm fine. Wait, what if it is? If the mines are reprogrammed, they're being guided by a computer. And like a game,  after a few moves, it anticipates what we'll do. We need to introduce randomness and chaos, sir. Delta Seven. Power and life-support systems are disabled everywhere, except for the data centre where  Control is located, so we'll have to beam over in EV suits. Captain, still no life signs, and gravity is out. That's frozen blood. Burnham to Discovery. Confirm visuals on EV suits. Yes, sir. Commander Nhan, can you find a way to turn life support back on? Let's stay close. Captain, I'm seeing clear signs of a struggle. There's more blood.  Looks like someone tried to pry these doors open. Or keep them from shutting. Not yet. That's a really good question. Burnham to Discovery. At least four dead. I'm guessing we'll find more.  But we've got gravity and atmosphere restored. Bodies are frozen solid. Captain, we have a problem. It's Admiral Patar. She's been dead two weeks. The doors closed on them deliberately. What could cause an entire station to malfunction? Trying to restore Admiral Cornwell's access to Control. Airiam, what are you doing? I'm fine. I'm fine. What the hell is happening to her? What did she bring over here? Oh, that's it. It wants to think. It wants to evolve. That data's like a road map for Control  to become fully conscious. When it does Yes, that's what Spock saw in his vision. I'll delete whatever she managed to upload. Damn it. I can't get in. She's trying to open the door from inside. What? No. No, I'm not gonna eject you into space. We can fight this, Airiam. The system corrupted her. If I can break in and take it offline, she'll be free. Captain, I don't wanna disobey your orders, but if this works One more minute! Because of me? What is Project Daedal...?",65

You said there was a problem, Paul? Not for you. In fact, we don't need warp cores. One of the Project Daedalus testing sites was on  Essof Four. You are savvier than he was. Don't be so binary.

Which means I have to be the bait. Are you insane? So we're going to the Ninth Circle of Hell to capture a Red Angel. I'd enjoy the irony of that  if this weren't so dangerous.

Discovery bridge, this is Lieutenant Spock. Prepare to lower shuttlebay forcefield and drop aft  shields for three point five seconds on my mark. Michael. You are at a safe distance, Michael. Without a destination point, we will not be able to open the wormhole. Michael. Michael, the Ba'ul ships arrived here piloted by the Kelpiens because your signal led Discovery to Kaminar. Yes, now. Precisely now. The signal's purpose was not simply to liberate the Kelpiens  but to prepare them for this. For this very moment. You used each signal to lead Discovery to an  element we would need to win this battle. And to Boreth, to acquire the time crystal. To Xahea to find the one woman in all the universe  who could power it. And to Terralysium to identify safe harbour once we're through the wormhole. The crystal showed you a possible future. That is correct. In order for us to push forward, you must go back and set the events of the  past in motion, which you have not yet done. Once you do, Control cannot evolve. They will lead you back here. Of that, I cannot be certain. One that is only logical. The future is still unwritten, Michael. The outcome can still change. Go, Michael! Now! Michael? Michael, I cannot. When my vessel was hit... My engines are disabled. There is no time. And even if there were, they would need to lower their shields to bring me aboard,  and they will not survive doing so. Not in this battle.

Before the Federation fell. There's no one around to enforce the Endangered Species Act. Except you.  May I ask? You seem to have this connection to things. Plants, the trance worms. What is it like, feeling everything? Do you still see them? I'm sorry. Sanctuary. Some of them still make it. 930 years. To ensure the future. A future. I didn't do it alone. I have no idea how to start looking for my ship. What happened? I'm Commander Michael Burnham, science officer, USS Discovery. Serial number SC0064-0974SHN. I need to locate the warp signature of a starship with the identifier NCC1031. What about the other sectors? You've been cut off from the other sectors? Entirely? I'm from the past, Mister Sahil. From before the Burn. Before the collapse. My ship was right behind me in the wormhole.  So either they landed somewhere way far out of comms range... or they're not here yet. In a thousand years. True believers. Mister Sahil, you are as real a Federation officer as any I have ever met. If you would do me the honour,  we need an acting communications chief who can keep searching for my ship. Will you accept the commission? Sometimes it's the only thing. If there are others out there, we'll find them. We will.",133

Lieutenant Detmer, full power. Follow our signal. Back to your stations! Lieutenant Detmer! Everyone. Everyone, back to your stations now! Detmer. Recommendation, Lieutenant? Quickly, please. A glacier? Ready the graviton beam. Activate deflector shields in bursts to cushion our landing. On my mark. This is Commander Saru. All decks prepare for impact. Rhys, fire now. Hold us steady, Lieutenant! Well done, Lieutenant Detmer. Your comrade is correct, Lieutenant. Get to sickbay. Status reports? Can you speculate on the cause of the systems outage? We are completely disconnected at present, yes. But... we are also together. And alive. If Commander Burnham landed elsewhere, I trust she is aware that we will find her as soon as we are able. Begin a search for the affected relays and conduits. Inform all you come in contact with to do the same.  Crew members are to work in pairs until internal communications are re-established. I will survey the damage in person. And... I am aware that you all may feel an expedited need to see and understand  what is out there. But our first priority is in here. The integrity of this ship and this crew. Am I clear? Lieutenant Rhys, you have the conn. Ensign, with me. Is there any discernible pattern? A design? Then... we are not on Terralysium. There is... life. How long for repairs, Mister Bryce? He will complete repairs as soon as he is able, Commander. All available hands are busy repairing the EPS grid.  Do you require medical attention? I have no desire to leave Commander Burnham on her own, but we must get all systems up and running as quickly as possible.  Wherever we have arrived, we are strangers. We cannot assume that we are welcome. Carry on, Mister Bryce. Are there other relevant details you've gathered thus far? Commander. We are all acutely aware of that. We will acquire what we need to repair our transtator as quickly as possible,  and we will reveal as little of ourselves as possible in the process. Assuming we arrived in the correct time, we carry with us a knowledge of certain past events that we cannot share,  lest we impact the present or future of any society with which we interact. Whether or not the local population  is more or less advanced is immaterial. We will adhere to their cultural standards. We will barter peacefully. We will not abandon what we believe. I am not asking you to participate, Commander. I am telling you what we will do in your absence. Ensign Tilly, you will join me. Report to sickbay. We will have Doctor Pollard administer appropriate treatment so that we may breathe naturally  in this atmosphere. Commander Nhan, I am placing you in charge of the ship's repairs. And I need you to assist  in the repair of the EPS grid. If we cannot fly to Commander Burnham's location, we are of no use to her. You are dismissed! I know. Keep talking, Ensign. Well, not to each other. I needed an engineer. An engineer I can trust. She's concerned for Michael and lacks the self-awareness to control her behaviour in such an unsettled state.  We are introducing ourselves to the future. You, Ensign Tilly, are a wonderful first impression. First contact. So it would appear. I would never expect any of my crew to not have fear. But I will ask you to contain it now. Are you with me, Ensign? Greetings. We mean no harm. Our ship crashed. I am Saru. This is Tilly. We are officers of Starfleet. You... have already identified our ship. Er, friends, our navigation system is damaged. What planet are we on? We are a science vessel. A piece of our communications equipment is damaged. Sufficient to power your vessels. I am confident that we can come to an agreement. Might I inquire as to why this Zareh inspires such fear? As I said, we have been adrift for quite some time. And you have no dilithium to gather what you need for yourselves. How long has he exploited your community? And the Federation has not intervened? But we've not held up our end of the deal... your dilithium. We are an older model. Our mission is not of your concern. Er... no. I gave him no choice. If you take issue with that, you may take issue with me. Zareh? I am willing to discuss an exchange. Those items for the release of Os'Ir and Tilly. Er, we will get further using the common tongue. Any success you achieve here will be short-lived, because we will not permit your tyranny to stand. I have made my position clear. I will not take you to our ship. If dilithium is your priority, you and I will discuss a reasonable trade here. Then we will go back to the ship  to retrieve the dilithium. 150 units. On my mark, get behind the bar. Go! Georgiou, you will not harm him further. That is an order. This is not who we are. Commander Georgiou, give me your weapon. This degree of violence is completely without justification. Give me your weapon. Now. We defeated Control and lost lives in the process. That sacrifice was not for this, Commander.  I am the acting captain of the vessel that brought you here. Stand down!

I'm the same person, Saru. And I'm not. Everything that we dedicated our lives to disappeared into madness. We thought we could imagine a future, and it turns out we were wrong.  I adapted. And I did what I had to to learn as much as I could about what happened and why. I just need some time. Book's ship can stay in the shuttle bay as long as it has our dilithium. Coordinates relative to galactic core confirmed. Initiating multiphasic scans and updating astrometric data. They do not bear Starfleet registries. Put these on. They're searching the ship. If anyone is not in full uniform, they'll be suspect. They could be arrested. You're Lieutenant Booker now. One aye. We're not pirates. Yes. When we saved each other. Oh... Mmm hmm. Just a uniform. To get you to join Starfleet? Look, you will be in your own clothes and on your own ship and petting your fat cat in no time. I am. After you, Lieutenant Booker. Seriously? Admiral? I just forgot what it felt like. Why are you still on Discovery, Philippa? Yes. Captain, all we want is to check in with Starfleet Command. What about the Starfleet officer who sent the transmission I received? That was just 12 years ago. Admiral Senna Tal. Scan us. We have no dilithium on board. I have a plan. Remember Donatu Seven? You do so. Well, we need to get to your ship. Unless you want to keep brooding into your synthehol... Mmm. You coming? I'll apologise after. Yeah. Feathers. Whatever they were, I was digging them out of my hair for days. We could do Radok Sien. He's hailing us. We have what you need. We want to make a deal. Scan our ship. You're weird. What do you care? We have a lot of it. We'll beam it over, but you have to leave Earth's orbit now. We're peace-loving individuals. No, not yet. Discovery will come through. He'll figure it out. Because he's Starfleet. Discovery can't take another hit. That means the next shot from Earth will end you. So you can either lower your shields and  let us beam the dilithium over and stay alive... When he lowers his shields, we're going to have to move fast. Special delivery. The dilithium is safe, and his people won't fire on us as long as we have their captain. It's time for you two to talk. Maybe you should talk to one another face-to-face. When we first scanned your ship, it was overcrowded, strained beyond its means. Not a typical raider ship. Captain Ndoye, can Earth provide engineers and equipment to Titan, so an accident like that doesn't happen again? Trill? I've seen Trills at the exchanges. I didn't know they carried symbionts. Including Admiral Tal's. I hope so. I should've told you about my plan. We have work to do, and I would be proud to do it by your side. But there are things in my year here that I let go of,  and I need time to find my way back to them. If I can. Then it would be my privilege to be your Number One. If things were easy... Are you sure you won't miss the uniform? You get a fresh start in a new quadrant. By my count we're even. Till next time. That's Starfleet Academy. Where is everyone? No. I think I'll admire the view from here. With you.",93

Every report, record and log that you asked for is ready to be handed over to Starfleet. Words aren't enough, are they? 930 years. I know that there will be protocol. I know that we'll have a lot of questions about The Burn. But there are other things  that I'd like to inquire about, as well. Yes, sir. And I know that I'm lucky to have someone to hope for. I really hope so, sir. We wouldn't have made it without you. Fascinating. The distortion field seems to be sustained by the collective energy of every ship within it. Their scans must be advanced enough to pick up her symbiont. Commander Michael Burnham. First officer. There won't be until you find out where they became infected. We could help you analyse their travel. My apologies if I overstepped. We're still analysing the cause of the spatial and temporal... variances in our exiting the wormhole.  Early indications suggest that Discovery may have hit a pocket of abnormal gravity waves. I sent it back into the wormhole to initiate the final signal. It was then programmed to self-destruct. The Sphere is a benevolent life-form that merged with Discovery. Its data is a record of everything seen and experienced by this entity  in the 100,000 years leading up to our departure. Sir, if I may ask, regarding The Burn, we... If we hadn't made the jump, all organic life in the universe would've ended, and we wouldn't be having this conversation, Admiral. The Federation that I remember would understand that there is no other crew with our experience. And certainly no other crew that  can operate the spore drive. Why aren't you fighting for us to stay together, then? Vance should make use of who we are now, not diminish us for it. Then let's help him make the right one. Well, so do I. But I also know that if this crew gets pulled apart now, some of us might never recover.  Now, if we can just get our hands on the roster of where the Kili have been, then we can help isolate the origin of the infectious protein,  we can jump there, we can find a cure, we can help make a difference for the Kili and show the admiral why we need to stay together. Of course. Lieutenant Willa, we submitted a request to see the roster of planets the Kili refugees visited. We've not yet heard back.  If we know where they went, we could find out what caused this. We're a science vessel. And the situations we've encountered... Lieutenant Willa. I'm sure we would respond the same way if the situation were reversed. But one fact is unassailable.  We have a spore drive and it works. We can travel anywhere in the blink of an eye. And we want to help. All we are asking is to be  permitted to look at the roster. Best case, you save lives. Worst case, you hate us a little more for wasting your time. The Federation was just beginning to sound the alarm about toxicity a thousand years ago. The atmosphere was thinning,  and they feared high concentrations of UVB radiation would mutate the biology of everything on the surface. And that is what happened. And whatever they ate was mutated. It was infected with misfolding proteins that have been spreading in their bodies ever since. In the 23rd century, there was a Federation seed-vault ship, the USS Tikhov. It held samples of every plant in the galaxy.  If it still exists, it will have seeds from before the planet's environmental collapse, and we can synthesize an antidote from that. Our spore drive can get us there and back in plenty of time. Admiral! You have a crew ready and able to fly now. You're going to waste precious time teaching a new crew the ins and outs  of a thousand-year-old ship flying through a mushroom network? Bring us to safe distance, please. Welcome aboard, Lieutenant Willa. We have three hours left to retrieve the seed sample and create an antidote for the Kili. Let's show them who we are.  You might want to hold on to something. Black alert. Bring it up. Yellow alert. Lieutenant Rhys, prepare tractor beams. We'll have to pull it out of the storm before we can beam on board. Lieutenant Detmer, get us over there. It's going to be a bumpy ride. Shields up. How are we doing on tractor beams? Lieutenant? Bryce, have Doctor Culber report to the bridge. Nice work, Keyla. Owo, what's the toxicity of the radiation on that ship? Tilly? There may be a medical emergency on the Tikhov. For the last 500 years, each planet of the Federation  has taken turns keeping watch over the seed vault. Looks like a Barzan family was most recent. You will today. I want you with us on this. Anyway, the atmosphere on board is attuned to Barzan biology, so we'll need breathing devices. The seed vault itself can only be accessed by beaming into and out of it, so the transporter chief will need to stay at the ready. Tilly, let me know what you find on radiation. And, Rhys, you have the conn. Let's go. Someone must have compromised the seed vault. None of these plants should be here. Your eyes. Four. Parents are scientists. They have two kids. Residual radiation must still be interfering with our instruments. We might not be able to rely on them.  Okay, seed vault should be this way. Behind us. Adira played that same melody. How is that possible? Nothing. See if you can find any sign of the family. I'm going in the vault. Burnham to Discovery. Do you copy?  I'm right outside the seed vault. One to beam in. Wow. Er... Damn it. Please, we're here to help! What? He was fighting me. He didn't want me to get to those seeds, and... there was something about his face.  It... folded in on itself before he disappeared. It was as if his entire body was out of phase, somehow. Well, any ideas as to what might have caused this? If there's logic to his behaviour, then maybe we can reason with him. And we need his voice code to access the vault,  or those refugees are as good as dead. The admiral has given us this chance. We can't fail. The phasing itself. It might explain why he survived and his family didn't. If we can figure out what happened,  then maybe we can fix him. The team should be nearly done analyzing the radiation. Tilly? Listen. Dr. Attis is the only survivor. He described the ship being hit by a bright light and the bodies of his family  are showing high concentrations of beta particles. He's also phasing uncontrollably. You're thinking CME. Is there a way to bring him back in phase? Tilly, do you have him? Got him, thank you. I couldn't even come close to understanding him the way Nhan does. Doctor Attis, it's time to let go. Your family's gone. And I think you know that. Just like I think you know there isn't anything  on board that can change that. But there is something on board that can help other families like yours. I know you had to watch them die.  I'm sorry. No one should ever have to go through that. But there are others that are about to walk where you've been walking, and you have  a chance to stop it. Please help us. Help them. Doctor Attis, thank you. Tilly, prepare to beam Doctor Attis directly to sickbay. Hugh, why don't you take these seeds back to Discovery, start working on an antidote? I respect Dr. Attis's personal choice, but Starfleet has always had its own mores. One of them being never to leave a person behind. Sometimes there is no good choice. Only what you can live with. I don't think that I can live with letting part of the Federation's history  die with him. Nhan, if you stay, you'd be giving up your career. A year ago, I would have. I really hope our paths cross again. One to beam back. Yes, sir. Sir. We have a spore drive that can take us anywhere, and a crew that operates as one breathing organism, and Sphere data that offers  thousands of years of wisdom. Keep us together and let us help. That's all we ask. We've all put our lives in Detmer's hands, and we'd do it again, sir. The Burn, sir. Are you at liberty to discuss it with us now? Which theory do you believe? Challenge accepted. And understood, sir. Oh, Lieutenant Willa. Did you find anything about that music that I asked you about? Don't you find that strange? The Barzan planet, the Tikhov, they're unimaginably far away from here without dilithium.  And there's no way Doctor Attis could have come anywhere near this sector. How is it that everyone knows the same piece of music? Philippa. Let me run something by you. There's this piece of music... Philippa. Philippa? Are you okay? I asked if you were okay. Not yet.

Even her nacelles are now detached,  improving maneouvrability and enabling us to be more efficient in flight. Her retrofit is nearly complete. It is quite extraordinary,  the journey we have had. We are grateful to have assisted Federation planets in the deepest regions of the galaxy, and equally grateful to be home. We are now ready to be of service here, in any way we can be. Adapting and retraining as needed. Commander Burnham is overseeing the process. With respect, Admiral, given severely limited warp travel, if time is of the essence... The Andorian - Orion syndicate? We will be ready, Admiral. What would the black box tell us about the Burn? Suggesting what? I'm so sorry, Michael, but at the moment, we cannot. Well, the admiral has ordered Discovery to be ready to jump to Argeth within the next 12 hours. Commander. To be clear, the situation there could heat up any time in the next 12 hours. There are many lives. Today, I saw how vulnerable the Federation has become. The admiral would not be convinced by a cat in a ship.  I understand this will be difficult, but please resume your duties and prepare the crew for a possible jump to Argeth. Ensign Tilly. I appreciate your diligence. Might I speak with you privately? I was hoping against all logic you could explain her absence. Commander Burnham left to pursue a mission of her own against my direct orders. My sentiments exactly. I will be honest, Ensign. I have not felt this mistrusting of her since we served on the Shenzhou.  I assumed, after all we have endured together, that this feeling would never return. I expected you to try talking me out of it. That is astute, Ensign. For the record, I do not believe you would have. There is no doubt Commander Burnham made a serious error in judgment. But you can be assured that the absence of our Number One  will not impact our ability to respond to any potential conflict on Argeth. We will begin preparations, Admiral. Noted, sir. Thank you, Admiral. The admiral made some excellent points. And I will continue to reflect on the way I have handled all this. We both made mistakes.  I was particularly disappointed. While I agree with your intentions, the decision I am now forced to make comes down to one thing and one thing only, Commander.  It's not about your skill. It's not about your ability. It is about trust. In your defence, you were clear in your ambivalence  when I asked you to be my Number One. In my desire to... return to a sense of... things as they were. But as we keep learning...  things are not as they were. I take no pleasure in this. But... as of now, you are relieved of your duty as my Number One. You will restrict yourself  to chief science officer duties only. One day... we will find the answers we are all looking for, Michael.",27

But the Vulcans were always the first to share their research with the Federation. Well, perhaps then, this new information would be sufficient to reopen diplomatic relations. Admiral, I must inform you, Commander Burnham was reprimanded for her insubordinate actions and dismissed as my first officer. I am sure you have heard I dismissed Commander Burnham as my first officer. I would like you to serve as my acting first officer until I find a permanent replacement. Part of leadership is the acknowledgment that one is suited to it. Many members of our crew have struggled with all that has changed.  I have watched you rise to the occasion. I believe you can help them rise, as well. And I believe you will always put the needs of Starfleet  and the Federation ahead of your own wishes. I'm asking   because I believe this is in the best interest of our ship. Take a day to think about it. Now let us jump to Ni'Var. Status report, please. Very well. The people of Ni'Var have not been visited by a Federation starship in nearly a century.  Let us remind them who we are and how important they are to us. Black Alert. Open the channel. Greetings. I am Saru of the USS Discovery. I assure you, we were not attempting to evade. Discovery is equipped with a system that allows us to travel across the mycelial network. Commander? So you gave her no choice. What is the protocol? I assume you are prepared? Welcome to Discovery. A special chamber has been prepared for the T'Kal-in-ket. Madam President, er... will you permit me to give you  a tour of our vessel? Forgive me, I'm not familiar with the Qowat Milat. The admiral was concerned that it could be polarising, given the Temporal Accords. Yet there was no other way to explain to you  the presence of Spock's sister. Duty called. Well, I am... troubled that... the Federation is so reduced. But I'm heartened that those who remain are committed to its core values. I have seen their commitment to member and non-member worlds alike. Forgive me if I'm overstepping, but... I know the Federation feels the loss of Ni'Var... keenly. I do hope that our visit  and Commander Burnham's discussions with the Quorum will open new channels of diplomacy. I would like to hear about them, if I may. Did your ancestors not coin the phrase, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few? Of course. But perhaps the Federation has acquired a newfound wisdom of its own. It has been my experience  that we learn our greatest lessons when we pay a heavy price. You must admit, the Federation has paid most dearly. The T'Kal-in-ket is this way. Ah. If I may. I understand the situation on Ni'Var is complex. Contemplating a future within the Federation may be premature at this time.

Excuse me. No, Elder, thank you. We are looking for Su'Kal. Do you know where he might be? Doctor Issa. She knew she was dying. That they were all dying and that Su'Kal would survive. Elder, we understand the nature of your programming, but in order to provide social and emotional support for the growing child, we must locate him. May I examine the book? Yeah. This totem. I saw these near the entrance. The All-Seeing Eye has become... protection? Su'Kal, he uses this design to build these totems.  What is he protecting himself from? They must face their deepest fear. I remember that story. Su'Kal's afraid of whatever's behind that locked door. That holo... it is the monster from Su'Kal's story. Michael, I must ask the impossible. I need you to stay. If we leave Su'Kal alone, it is only a matter of time before the Burn happens again. With your xenoanthropological skills... I am the captain. Osyraa is here.
