I laid it all out. By using reserve duty officers and mothballed ships, we could maintain  the evacuation, though to a severely reduced level. All synthetic lifeforms are banned, throughout the Federation, effective immediately.  All active units are dismantled and all research is halted. They said it was a fatal code error in the operating system. Ah. The Tal Shiar. Raffi, why would the Romulans attack a fleet built expressly to rescue them? You're absolutely right. Mars is burning. Tens of thousands are dead. And nobody is thinking,  nobody is listening. They're just reacting. They said that our plan was unfeasible. Half of them never wanted to rescue the Romulans  in the first place. And the rest are... are just frightened. I never dreamed that Starfleet would  give in to intolerance and fear. I said that either they accept the revised evacuation plan or my resignation. They accepted my resignation. To mount a multi-world evacuation of tens of millions of Romulans without Starfleet's support? My resignation was the last, desperate, wild solution. I never believed that they would accept it. Raffi? There were two of them. One of them is already dead. I only hope that I'm in time to save the other one.  Raffi, I need a ship and a pilot, and I have to find Bruce Maddox. Yeah. It's a lot to take in. An unmitigated disaster. I know. Don't, Raffi. Raffi. Raffi! It makes total sense that you're angry. I disappointed you. I neglected you.  And I wasn't there when you needed me. I'm truly sorry. Raffi, there is a unit of Tal Shiar synth hunters operating on Earth, openly.  That could not happen without Federation complicity. You always said there were Romulan-Federation connections I didn't see. Raffi Raffi, they had no reason to sabotage their own rescue. That's why I need your help. I need your mind. Your ability to see things others don't see. Raffi... Rios. Thank you. You're doing the research, aren't you? I'm sending you everything that Daystrom had on Bruce Maddox. Carry on. Captain Rios? Picard. Are you...? I'm er... What happened to you? No, thanks. I'm working on it. As soon as possible. I don't know. I'm not in the habit of consulting lawyers before I do what needs to be done. You? Duly noted. I need a pilot. Raffi says you're the best around. Ha. Wise man. You were the XO of a heavy cruiser. Do I detect a certain bitterness toward Starfleet? You must know that Starfleet and I long since  have parted ways. Oh, really? I see this ship is impeccably maintained. Every bolt and clasp and fitting in place.  Everything stowed in regulation Starfleet order. I don't know what happened to you, Rios, or to the ibn Majid.  But five minutes on this ship, and I know precisely what I'm looking at. You are Starfleet to the core.  I can smell it on you. The familiar smell of harvest time. Wood smoke, mown hay and that heavy sweetness of the grapes. Oh yes, my dear. I will miss you and Zhaban and Number One. I tried my best to belong to this place,  but I don't think I ever truly felt at home here. They killed the alarm. It's all right. Thank you. It's all right. Come. Here. Chief of Starfleet Security. A Vulcan. No, but I hear that she's very good at her job. Of course. It's all right. Let's talk. Why is the Tal Shiar on Earth? Are you Zhat Vash? If you answer my questions, I will release you. Why did you kill that girl? Why did you kill Dahj Asha? Just help me understand what is happening. Why did you kill her? Is there another one like her? Where is she? Where is the other one? Damn. You said you told Commodore Oh everything about our conversation except for one thing. What was that? You're early.

And while Jussac was recovering himself, d'Artagnan glided  like a serpent beneath his blade, and passed his sword through his body. Jussac fell in a heap.  D'Artagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of battle. I'm busy, Raffi. What do you mean, synths have attacked Mars? Of course. It must. Tell Elnor I'm sorry we didn't finish our fencing lesson, but, er...  Well, I'll be back soon. Picard ready for transport. Hold. Everything seems absolutely correct, in every particular. I see that. It seems a little odd that a working ship should have a hospitality hologram. Mmm hmm. Come. Look, Dahj's sister is in grave danger. She may already be dead.  I am as eager to get to Freecloud as you. Oh, well, that will make a refreshing change. Come. Please, Doctor Jurati, join us. Raffi here was questioning my sanity. But the Qiris sector is in the Fenris Rangers' territory. They are not assassins, and you can't hire them. The Qowat Milat have to choose you. I know... knew some Qowat Milat. On Vashti alone, they helped Raffi and me relocate  more than a quarter of a million refugees. And they are the most skilled single-combat fighters  that I have ever seen, and the most feared enemies of the Tal Shiar. They have their own criteria whether to give or withhold their assistance to a cause. Let's just say that I am confident that they will find ours worthy, and if they don't,  the Way of Absolute Candor means that they won't hesitate to tell us. It's their primary teaching. Total communication of emotion without any filter between thought and word.  And it runs entirely counter to everything that the Romulans hold dear. Resume. Elnor. One impossible thing at a time. I may never pass this way again. I'll be in my quarters. Of a sort. For a moment. Security? Do we have clearance? Call Central Station. Tell them it's me. Very well. Suggestions? Jolan tru. Jolan tru. Jolan tru, Qowat Milat. You didn't. I don't have the right, but I need your help one last time. No, not now, Raffi. I need more time. I am quite safe here. Well, you do what you have to do, and I need more time. Picard out. Do the Qowat Milat still bind their blades to a singular cause? Er, no, thank you, Elnor. Elnor? I always imagined that you had found a suitable place for him. But it's not just Elnor. It's everything here. The poverty, the degradation, the ethnic strife.  When I left here, there was none of this. Yes. I allowed the perfect to become the enemy of the good. I am taking on the Tal Shiar, alone. It is to me. If I'm not too late. He completed his training? So he really is a Qowat Milat? And you would send him away? He might find himself in serious danger. He might die. When you bind your sword to a cause, is there some kind of protocol? A ritual? Do... do I go on my knees?  Oh, I do hope not. Between the two of us, my knees are not what they used to be. I had a friend called Data. He died. He gave his life to save mine, and I have missed him ever since. Of course I did. Well, recently, I've learned that Data... this is complicated... that Data had two offspring. And one of them, her name was Dahj, was murdered in front of me. The other one, I believe, is in serious danger,  and I have to find her before the Tal Shiar do. Yes. Mmm hmm. That's right. Well, if you come with us, you might just run across one or two of them. Because I failed to protect her sister. No. It's just a guess. Likely. Anticipated, actually. Because I'm an old man and you're a young one, and you're strong. Zani told me that  you are one of the best fighters that she has ever seen. It seems to me that my quest has the  appropriate criteria. Will you come with me? Will you bind your sword to my quest? I never meant to. Elnor, it...! Rios, it's Picard. I'm ready for transport. Jolan tru. Waiter. Waiter! Have we? Forgive me. I er... Senator... Thank you. We had so little time. There were so many of you to save. I did everything I could. My friends, I grieve. That is not so! I promise you No. No! Enough, Elnor. The Federation has failed you all. I failed you all. I broke faith with you,  and the result was terrible pain and loss for you all.  And I am sorry. That man did not deserve to die. Now, you listen to me, carefully. I will benefit by your skill and your courage,  but if you bind yourself to my cause, I will tell you when to fight and when to refrain. Is that understood? Swear it. Doctor Jurati, Raffi, this is Elnor. I have to ask you, what made you decide to bind yourself to my cause? A qalankhkai will only bind herself... himself to a lost cause. Open a channel. Er... Raffi, beam him in, directly here. Elnor. Seven of Nine?",94

Turns out, yes, I can. Tell me about it. I do. Yes, I have mucus. You know a lot about Data. I don't see how this Data could be my father.

I thought he even loved me. I trusted him,  but it was all a mind game. He was trying to trick me into remembering information he needed.  And then he tried to kill me. You think? This way that you're being right now, all sensitive and caring, that makes me trust you less.  I don't trust you or Kestra. I definitely don't trust Picard. This whole thing, if it's even really  happening, how do I know it's not another game? That it isn't real? Like my childhood. Like my parents.  You bring me to this beautiful place, surround me with warm, friendly people and good food, and Thank you. I do like pizza. Home.

I'm talking about how big a fool you really are. A neuron. That's all you know about her. You built this whole giant fantasy of... of rescue  and sacrifice and redemption out of one pissant little neuron. Agnes Jurati had a tracking isotope in her blood. She's a Romulan spy. Theory. We think she killed Bruce Maddox. And as soon as she did, we shook our Tal Shiar tail. Fact, not theory. Maybe. Or maybe they put her on this ship to kill Bruce Maddox. Right after they got done  killing Soji's sister. Mmm hmm. Oh! I told you it was careless to bring her along. Now you're telling us that we need to trust  the synth girl, too? Tell me, JL. What is Soji really like, hmm? Do you know? Does she?  Yeah, that's what I thought. To tell Rios I was right about Jurati. I'm gonna see if it feels any better to rub his face in it. Hmm. You all right, buddy? You seemed a little, uh, rattled back there. The Tal Shiar had a tracker inside your girl Jurati, and it looks like she killed Bruce Maddox. Er, yeah. Unless you like giant, all-encompassing, paranoid conspiracy theories.  Then it's, you know, kind of awesome. You know, in a horrible way. Goddamn it! Which one are you? Where is Rios? Did he tell you why he got so freaked out by that girl? Hmm. Her name is Soji. Oh. Er, this, er, this caught my eye while I was surveilling the Cube. All these Romulans sitting  around drawing this, over and over. Eight circles, see? Could those be planets? A what now? Hmm? All this time I've been thinking that the Conclave of Eight was eight people who planned the attack on Mars,  but maybe the name refers to the place where they met. You are my favorite holo. Chris? Are you Chris? First of all, I'm gonna ask you never to call me lassie again. Have you seen Rios? Hiding out? From what? From Soji? And why is that? Where does he know her from? Mmm.
