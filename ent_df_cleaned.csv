You don't seem to be very interested in what people do here. Do you have any records of a Suliban vessel coming in around the same time? Go ahead. Where on level nineteen? I'll meet you there as soon as I can. Archer out. Enclave can mean a lot of things. Hello! Excuse me! Archer to T'Pol. T'Pol, come in. There are plenty of people right here. Stay behind me. Who the hell are you? I was hoping you could tell me. They looked a lot like your friends outside. How come you don't look like your friends? What I'd prefer is that you give me Klaang back. Home. We were just taking him home. You'd better be careful. I'm a lot bigger than you are. What are you doing? You know, under different circumstances, I might be flattered by this, but. That's never happened before. You're Suliban Evolution? So you know I'm not lying to you. Now what? How do you know that? What kind of message? Why would the Suliban want that? Temporal? You've lost me. What? On the roof. Docking port three. Trip! Come on! Lieutenant Reed, this is Archer. Come in. We're on the roof. You need to get up here as quickly as you can. Get Hoshi to the ship. Now! Go! I said go! How long have? Thanks. That depends. What's been going on the last six hours? Are we underway? You didn't waste much time, did you? How long before we get back to Earth? You got their plasma decay rate? What happened to this is a foolish mission? As acting Captain, you could've done whatever the hell you wanted to do. Dismissed. Enterprise Starlog, Captain Jonathan Archer. April 16th, 2151. We've been tracking the Suliban ship for ten hours, thanks to our Science Officer, who came up with a way to tweak the sensors. Computer, pause. I save her life, and now she's helping us with the mission. One good turn deserves another doesn't sound very Vulcan. Resume log. I have no reason to believe that Klaang is still alive but if what the Suliban woman told me is true, it's crucial that we try to find him. Computer, pause. Have you ever known a Vulcan to return a favour? No, neither have I. Resume log. I still haven't decided whether to ask Sub-Commander T'Pol about this Temporal Cold War. My instincts tell me not to trust her. Computer, pause. Archer to T'Pol. Report. From the looks of it, a class six or seven. We've lost them. Move us in closer. Anything? You finished helping us? You heard her. Recalibrate the sensor array. Narrow band, short to mid range. Your instincts were right. Those fragments weren't from one Suliban ship How are your targeting scanners? Bring the weapons online and polarise the hull plating. Lay in a sixty degree vector. We're going in. Travis? I wouldn't exactly call this an improvement. It's just a little bad weather. Level off. Go to long range scans. Put it up. What kind of weapons? All sensors. Get whatever you can. Go tighter. Bio-signs? Just a little trouble with the bad guys. Take us up. What've you got? Even if it is Klaang, we'd have a tough time getting him out of there We've risked too much to bring him back inside out. Would the grappler work in a liquid atmosphere? Bring it online. One more time, Mister Mayweather. Hold your position. Hold your position. Now, Mister Reed. Release the inertial clamps here, here, and here then initialize the coaxial ports. I don't doubt it, but I need you here. You're gonna have to speed this up a little, Travis. We'll be back before you know it. Have Mayweather plot a course for Kronos. I was beginning to think you understood why we have to do this alone. Never put off 'til tomorrow. Am I sensing concern? Last time I checked, that was considered an emotion. Come in. You finished? Ah. Our new weapons. Time to go. The ship is yours. What's that? That's reassuring. Bring the docking interface online. The coaxial ports. Let's go. Bank starboard, ninety degrees. That's the upper support radius. Drop down right below it. Start a counter clockwise sweep. A little more. A little more. Right there. Stun seems to work. I really don't want to have to carry you out of here. You okay? I think he gets the idea. Give him a hand. Be quiet. Give me the box. Get to the ship. I'll be right behind you. It worked, Trip. Still on the central core. Get Klaang back to Enterprise. Get him to the ship. You can come back for me. Believe me, I'll try. What is this room? What goes on in here? Am I supposed to be impressed that you know my name? Well, I guess you have me at a disadvantage. So why don't you drop this invisible man routine and let me see who I'm talking to? This chameleon thing is pretty fancy. Was it payment for pitting the Klingons against each other, or a trophy from your Temporal Cold War. Really? Then you obviously don't know as much about me as you thought you did. What's the matter? No genetic tricks to keep you from getting knocked on your butt? So to speed things up a little, you struck a deal with the devil. I'll take that as a thank you. What did he say? Come in. I've just gotten a response to the message I sent to Admiral Forrest. He enjoyed telling the Vulcan High Command about the Suliban we ran into. It isn't every day he gets to be the one dispensing information. I wanted you both to hear Starfleet's orders before I inform the crew. Your people are sending a transport to pick you up. It would be a little out of our way. Admiral Forrest sees no reason why we shouldn't keep going. I have a feeling Doctor Phlox won't mind staying around for a while. He's developing a fondness for the human endocrine system. I think that outer hull's going to need a little patching up. Let's hope that's the last time somebody takes a shot at us. T'Pol, would you stick around for a minute? Ever since I can remember, I've seen Vulcans as an obstacle, always keeping us from standing on our own two feet. No, I don't think you do. If I'm going to pull this off, there are a few things I have to leave behind. Things like preconceptions, holding grudges. This mission would've failed without your help. I was thinking. A Vulcan Science Officer could come in handy, but if I asked you to stay it might look like I wasn't ready to do this on my own. Perhaps I should. Permission granted. I hope nobody is in a big hurry to get home. Starfleet seems to think that we're ready to begin our mission. I understand there's an inhabited planet a few light years from here. That's what we're here to find out. Prepare to break orbit and lay in a course. We can't be afraid of the wind, Ensign. Take us to warp four.",220

That ship could have a lot of decks. You might need someone to help you figure out the turbolifts. Okay, I've got a better reason why you need an engineer. Because your engineer signed onto this mission of exploration so he could do a little exploring. He didn't sign on to sit in Engineering while you three get to break into that ship. You're chomping at the bit to find out what's in there. Why should I be any different? What kind of pasta is this? It's great. Not too spicy for you? Malcolm's anxious to run another weapons test, especially after what happened. Tea? Captain? I heard they were humanoid. Is that right? Did they look anything like us? But you didn't recognise the species. I saw one once through the big lens outside Anchorage. You said it yourself, sir. Whoever killed those people are probably coming back. Aye, sir. Yeah. Beats me. Could be a laundry list or instructions on how to conquer the universe. Their transceiver's intact. Let's hope the next time we make first contact it isn't with a room full of corpses. A minute or two. I can't get enough of this. An alien spaceship sending off a message to who knows where. It's your second away mission in two days. I wish I had an ear for languages. The Captain's going to need a translator with him a lot more often than an engineer. Wow. You serious? Give it a try. You'll be fine. You can't be sure of that.

Nearly nine months without running into a soul. There were five kids on board. We were at each others throats within a matter of weeks. First officer and my mother came up with the idea to teach us how to play geography. You know, you say Amazon River, which ends in an R. I say Rhode Island. Don't tell me, I know an X. Xanadu. Doesn't matter. Well, you used an alien planet, Dralax. Point five microns. Range, five thousand kilometres. Are those venting ports or hull breaches? Maybe they're in trouble. Sick or something. Mayweather here, sir. Aye, sir. We've reversed course, sir. We should be back at the coordinates in five hours. Distance, sixty thousand kilometres. Ten minutes, maybe less. The pod's on the arm. We're dead in the water, sir. What was that? Sir, another vessel just dropped out of warp. They're on an intercept course. I can't, sir. Their beam's disrupting all our propulsion systems. We've got impulse back.",28

They could be friendly. Slow down, crewman. That's an order. Stay here. Travis. Travis! I saw one. It came right out of that rock like it was a part of it. It's too dangerous. We should go back. We've lost Novakovich and we're apparently not alone. There's some kind of lifeform down here. We're heading there now, sir. Not a moment too soon. From what I saw, these things live inside the rock. Crewman? Neither does she. You keep claiming these creatures don't exist, but the rest of us have all seen them. That's a little strange, don't you think? I'd like to believe you, but you Vulcans don't exactly have a spotless track record when it comes to being honest with us. You've held things back before. You might be doing it again. Tucker here. Captain, aren't you forgetting something? We'll do our best, sir. Understood. You heard the Captain. He wants to know about your friends. What are you going to tell him? What are you going to tell him? Is it? We're stuck down here for God knows how long with a bunch of rock people who, for all we know, are staring at us from these walls right now. Not to mention a crewman out there who probably won't last the night. Now if we're going to get through this, I need to know what the hell's going on. You beginning to see my point? You couldn't care less about him or any of the rest of us. That would require some of those useless human emotions. You've never seen me irrational. Great. We'll have to conserve what's left. How do we know you're not going in there to talk to your friends? Sit down. You heard me. What are you doing? On what. Find anything you want to tell me about? That's what you'd like us to think. Let me see that thing. No, but Hoshi would. This could be evidence. Your little conspiracy. Oh? Your people have been telling us that kind of crap for a hundred years. Looks like you finally found a way to put us back in our cage. Imagine the news back home, Travis. Enterprise crew found dead. Six weeks into their historic voyage, the bodies of all eighty two crewmembers were located on an uninhabited world. A Vulcan ship made the unfortunate discovery. Cause of death remains a mystery. But what the Vulcans won't say is they know exactly who attacked us. In fact, they arranged the whole thing. They lured us down here so they could sabotage our mission. We know you're here. Why don't you show yourselves? You're not afraid of us, are you? Maybe you're waiting for the others to come down so you can kill us all at once. Did you see that? Sounds like you're getting a little volatile yourself, Sub-Commander. I thought you had your emotions all locked up. Having a little problem, are you? You think I'm going to wait around here for you to slaughter us? I'll blow this whole cave apart if I have to. I know you hear me! My suspicions were Right on the nose, Captain. Our little Vulcan here is Not what she appears to be. Never was. There's some kind of Creatures down here. They hide inside solid rock. Travis and I have both seen them. Cutler saw two of them talking to T'Pol. They're up to something but of course, she denies it. Are you telling me those creatures aren't real? We didn't imagine this, Captain. You're not down here, Captain. You don't understand what's going on. Travis. You still with me? I need you on your feet. Those things could come back at any time. Listen to me. I'm giving you an order. What's wrong? Ensign? What'd you do to him? I can see why you get along so well with them, sneaking around in the shadows. That's second nature to you Vulcans, isn't it. I have no idea what you just said, but it didn't sound very nice. You're making a mistake working with her. She'll stab you in the back first chance she gets. Tell you what. Come out and we'll settle this peacefully. Whatever she told you about humans, it's not true. You can see for yourself. Say something! What are you doing her? Yes, sir. I know, I know, but they're not giving me much choice. I've got to protect my crew. I understand, Mister Velik, but I can't do that. They're trying to kill us. Nice try. Stay awake, Travis. I can't afford to have you going out on me. Cutler, you okay? If you're waiting for me to pass out, you're wasting your time. You might as well have your friends come out now, do whatever they're going to do. Who's that? Taking an injection isn't going to change a damn thing, don't you see that? They're planning something, Captain. First us, then all of you. Say one more word of that gibberish and I'm going to split you in two. The only thing that's affecting her are those rock people. If I can stop her now, I can save Enterprise. What's that got to do with anything? What's your point! Too late, Captain. I'm not going to die with a hypospray in my hand. No! It's not going to happen. Captain? Hello? I'm waiting for that order But I can't wait much longer. Go ahead. Why couldn't you tell me that? If it was so top secret, then why'd you let us all come down to the surface? Let us spend the night? I understand. Go ahead. You didn't shoot me last night, did you? Are they gone? The pollen? Then what about that speech you gave to the wall? A pretty good performance. Look, I know I kind of shot my mouth off last night. Challenge you preconceptions or they'll challenge you. That's something Mister Velik used to say. Tenth grade biology class. He was a Vulcan scientist (who came to teach us about life on other worlds. I'd never seen a Vulcan before, not up close. He scared the hell out of me.",118

I wish we had time to answer all of them, but if we did that, we wouldn't get much exploring done. So I've selected a few, and hopefully our answers will give you a better idea of what life is like out here. Liam Brennan asks 'what do you eat?' For the most part, the same things you eat at home. Our Chef can make anything from a peanut butter and jelly sandwich to turkey with all the trimmings. We have a hydroponic greenhouse onboard where we grow fruits and vegetables, and we can also replicate certain foods with our protein resequencer. Here's one from Geoff Miles. 'Is dating allowed on Enterprise?' Well, it's not discouraged, but there isn't a lot of privacy on a starship. Most of our crew share quarters with at least one other person, so it wouldn't exactly be practical. But if two crewmembers decide that they really like each other, there are a lot of places they can go to look at the stars. Chloe O'Shannon wants to know, 'how do we talk to aliens?' I think I'll give that one to my Communications Officer, Ensign Hoshi Sato."", ""Thanks, Hoshi. Here's one from Molly McCook. 'When you flush the toilet, where does it go?'

Senior staff Please report to the Bridge. Take us closer, Ensign. Ever seen anything like that in your astronomy books? I always wanted to chase a comet. Maybe we should spend a few days following this one. Except this one's bigger than any comet humans have ever seen. That's got to be worth a look. Stay with it, Travis. Eisilium? I've never heard of eisilium. This could be your chance. Can we collect a sample with the transporter? How long would you need? You up for a little comet walk? Get started. Hail them. This is Captain Jonathan Archer of the Starship Enterprise. Pleased to meet you. Not at all. Just taking a look at this comet. Really? My science officer tells me that Vulcans that Vulcans aren't very interested in comets. We plan to send a drilling team to the surface to collect core samples. You're welcome to participate. Stay as long as you want. T'Pol. I'd love to know what they're really doing here. You don't find anything strange about them suddenly showing up? Curious? That doesn't sound very Vulcan to me. This isn't the first time we've caught them lurking around. Remember three weeks ago, the planetary nebula? So why didn't they respond to our hails? Why'd they go to warp when we headed toward them? I'm starting to get the feeling they're looking over our shoulder a little too often. We'll see. Fine. If Vanik is the kind of guy who likes to watch, let him. You're sure this was sent to her quarters. Not a word. We had an agreement. She promised not to speak to the Vulcans without telling me. Tell her it's top priority. Stay put, Commander. This is important. Start the recording. To the students of Miz Malvin's fourth grade class at the Worley Elementary School in Kenmare, County Kerry, Ireland. This is Captain Archer aboard the starship Enterprise. On behalf of the entire crew, I'd like to thank you for your transmission. We all got a real kick out of your drawings and letters. You asked a lot of interesting questions. I wish we had time to answer all of them, but if we did that, we wouldn't get much exploring done. So I've selected a few, and hopefully our answers will give you a better idea of what life is like out here. Liam Brennan asks 'what do you eat?' For the most part, the same things you eat at home. Our Chef can make anything from a peanut butter and jelly sandwich to turkey with all the trimmings. We have a hydroponic greenhouse onboard where we grow fruits and vegetables, and we can also replicate certain foods with our protein resequencer. Here's one from Geoff Miles. 'Is dating allowed on Enterprise?' Well, it's not discouraged, but there isn't a lot of privacy on a starship. Most of our crew share quarters with at least one other person, so it wouldn't exactly be practical. But if two crewmembers decide that they really like each other, there are a lot of places they can go to look at the stars. Chloe O'Shannon wants to know, 'how do we talk to aliens?' I think I'll give that one to my Communications Officer, Ensign Hoshi Sato. Thanks, Hoshi. Here's one from Molly McCook. 'When you flush the toilet, where does it go?' That sounds like an engineering question, so we'll ask Commander Charles Tucker, our Chief Engineer. Trip. It's a perfectly valid question. You're doing fine. Very enlightening, Commander. Gabrielle Witty wants to know if germs can live in space. Thank you, Doctor. Fascinating. I think we've taken up enough of Miz Malvin's classroom time. By the way, we've included some pictures of a comet we're studying. We think it might be the biggest one ever discovered by humans or Vulcans. That's what's so exciting about being on Enterprise. You never know what you're going to find next. We miss Earth, but hearing from you makes us all feel a little closer to home. Captain Archer, out. How'd it go? Archer to Lieutenant Reed. How are you doing, Malcolm? I'm sure I don't need to remind you we're being observed. We want this to go as smoothly as possible. Make a good impression. So tell me, Who's the sculptor? Archer out. Come in. And? What did it say? What do you mean? Why the hell was it encrypted? Let it go, Trip. Come on, it was an honest mistake. How's that going to help? You're a good man. You might want to take a phase pistol with you. Archer to T'Pol. Please report to my Ready room. I thought I'd invite Captain Vanik for a visit. If he's so interested in how we do things, he might as well come see for himself. Once he realises we're not going to blow up the galaxy, maybe he'll leave us alone. Dinner's a good way to break the ice. I was hoping you might give Chef some menu suggestions. A little food, a little wine. You know what I mean. Just help me make him go away. Go ahead. Stand by. Inform the Vulcans we're about to make a very loud noise. Archer to Reed. Blast away. If I'm not mistaken, you're flying a Surak class ship. You can get her up to, what, six, six point five? A few years back I was a guest aboard a Maymora class ship, the Yarahla. Captain Tok. Do you know him? Oh. We made a run to a dark matter nebula. I helped set up the graviton telescope.

I grew up on a J-class, a little smaller but the same basic design, and one thing I can tell you is that at warp one point eight you've got a lot of time on your hands between ports. That's how my parents wound up with me. Well, typically nothing more than a low-yield plasma cannon, but most freight haulers would've upgraded the first chance they got. Think about it. You're a dozen light years from home with twenty kilotons of dilithium ore in your hold, armed with nothing but a pop-gun for shooting oncoming meteors. What would you do? Aye sir. There should be an auxiliary hatch on the port side. Pirates, sir. They've been attacking freighters in this sector for years. My parents had a run-in with them once. They were lucky to come out of it alive. Still do. An old J-class, the Horizon. He's got a lot more experience than any freighter medic I know. Trip'll get a kick out of this, it's older than he is. The Quartermaster won't have anything like it but Engineering should be able to make one for you. I'm sure your guys have their hands full. We're happy to do it. Enterprise came with all the trimmings. Not yet. Most of the crew is afraid, but I'm kind of curious to try it out. Why do you think I want to try it. I was born on her, halfway between Draylax and Vega Colony. I've still got my sister and her husband aboard the Horizon, but I know my dad expected me to take over at some point. I had to figure out where I wanted to spend the rest of my life, and I was pretty sure it wasn't on the Draylax - Vega run. Besides, the Horizon didn't have transporters to play with. Even with a warp three engine you'd be able to cut a five year cargo run down to six months. Save room for dessert, home made ice-cream. Chef's the best in Starfleet. I heard the Captain had to call in a lot of favours to get him on board. It's good you stayed away from the resequenced meat loaf. They still haven't gotten that right. That's because it is. I remember those. What did we used to call them? My dad was a pretty good cook. He could do magical things with those nutri-paks. Didn't stop you from eating it. Your parents on the Fortunate? Were you on board? I'm sorry. You ever think about doing something else? The food's not bad. No, but you've spent more time in space than most Starfleet Captains. There are three more NX class ships on the drawing boards. They're going to need experienced people. Don't worry, not everybody's going to go. You think leaving the Horizon was easy for me? That I just took off because I got tired of the food? That ship was my home. Being in Starfleet is the best thing that ever happened to me. My parents weren't happy I left, but they respected my decision. They're charging weapons. Aye, sir. They're jettisoning our pod. Their warp drive's coming online. We don't know where they are, but we know who they're looking for. The Nausicaans. Ryan's after revenge, sir. It's rational to him. Those pirates attacked his ship. That's his family. If we want to find the Fortunate, we need to find the Nausicaans. No. Try bypassing circuit L-47. Never thought I'd see a Y-class running from any ship I was on. When I was growing up on the Horizon, anything that happened on board you handles yourself. If someone on the crew got into a fight, you just worked it out. You took care of your own. If Starfleet suddenly showed up and told my father what he could and couldn't do on his own ship? Maybe he already has and he just doesn't like it. Do you have a minute, sir? Permission to speak freely, sir? I'm worried that we're not handling the situation the right way. You know I'd never question your orders. Maybe Ryan's right. Maybe this isn't any of our business. If he doesn't want our help, why force it on him. Don't underestimate a freighter crew, sir. My father never ran into any trouble he couldn't handle himself, Nausicaans included. Sir? He'd probably try to blow them out of the sky. You're right, sir. I suppose I should understand that more than anyone. Not today, sir. Thank you, sir. Aye, sir. He wouldn't be there if you hadn't attacked them in the first place. What are you going to do, kill him? Sir, with your permission. You think killing one of them is going to accomplish anything? Just shut up and listen to me. I don't give a damn about you any more. I'm just thinking about my family. What's going to happen to the next freighter that runs into the Nausicaans? What if it's the Horizon and they have to pay the price for your Stubborn stupidity. The hell you are! This isn't about protecting cargo ships. Don't kid yourself into thinking you're doing this for some greater good. This is about revenge, nothing else. You don't like me because I left the Horizon to join Starfleet. You're afraid that if more people do that there won't be anyone left to run the freighters. Maybe you're right Maybe not. But if you don't let your hostage go The Nausicaans are going to kill you and your crew. And then there'll be twenty three fewer people out there to run those freighters. No maybes.",66

That doesn't mean that it was given to them by visitors from the future. Until Daniels can offer you concrete proof, I'd remain extremely skeptical. If Daniels could travel through time why not simply go back one more day into the past and prevent Silik from boarding this ship in the first place? Or maybe he's really not from the future. He could be trying to conceal his true intentions. There's a difference between keeping an open mind and believing something because you want it to be true. Commander? One of the power relays is offline. T'Pol to Captain Archer. We've finished the modifications. Mister Daniels is eager to get started. What is it? He's in his quarters. No, the Plume is just beginning. Captain? Took what? Bridge to Captain Archer. A Suliban vessel just took something in and went to warp. Should we go after them? The transport ship has left. We're ready to resume course. Have you learned how it works? I'd be glad to help. Agreed.",34

We're on a mission of exploration from the planet Earth. Hoshi? Do you need assistance? If you don't want to talk, that's fine but, you dropped in on us. Was it something I said? Did you get anything on sensors? No what? Are there inhabited systems nearby? Why fly right up to us just to give us the silent treatment? Let's calibrate the subspace amplifier. At least the people back home want to talk to us. Where are they? What time is it there? That shouldn't be too late. Let's break in that new amplifier. I'll be in my Ready Room. He's fine. No, sir. Malcolm's doing a great job. I'm sure you know it's his birthday in a couple of days. He's my Armoury Officer. It must be in Malcolm's blood. He's a long way from home in any case, Mister Reed. I'd like to do something for his birthday, make him a special dinner. I was hoping you could tell me what he likes to eat. I'm not sure I understand. Are you saying he doesn't have a favourite food? Well, if you happen to think of anything you can always contact me through Starfleet. I will. Could have gone better. Apparently, he hasn't called home since we left Earth. I want you to find out what he likes to eat. But don't let Malcolm know. We're talking about a delicate assignment, Hoshi. It needs your finesse. Get some help if you need it, but make this a top priority. That's an order. Where were you at dinner? You missed T'Pol's latest bout with chopsticks. I thought you were going to upgrade this. What's the word from home? Duvall got his own command? Thank God we're a hundred light years away. The Natalie, from Pensacola? Trip. You okay? Let me ask you something. Do you spend much time with Malcolm? You talk about anything interesting? I talked to his parents this morning. Yeah. Sit. If I asked your parents what you like to eat, would they be able to tell me? Malcolm's parents didn't know what his favorite food was. They didn't even know he was an Armoury Officer. It made me think. We don't know that much about Malcolm, do we? Go ahead. Guess we weren't so uninteresting after all. Let's try this again. Welcome back. I was hoping we'd have an opportunity to meet again. The primary mission of my ship is to make peaceful contact with other species. If there's anything we can do to assure you of our intentions Well, it's been nice talking to you. Let's do this again sometime. Can you translate it? Hull plating. Hard about. Everybody okay? What the hell was that about? What did you get? Stay on long-range scanners. If they come anywhere near us, I want to know. T'Pol. How bad is it? Hold it a minute. Did your people run into as many hostile aliens when they first went into deep space? How so? This ship just isn't equipped to handle some of the threats we're coming up against. It's time we do something about that. Enterprise was fitted with phase cannon ports, but since we left Spacedock a few weeks ahead of schedule the cannons were never installed. I think it's time they were. We should head back to Earth. The armoury team at Jupiter Station is trained for this kind of work. If we're going to do this let's do it right. I know that, Trip, but we have other systems that could use overhauls. Look at the bright side. You'll got a chance to say goodbye to Natalie. Do what you can. Archer to Mayweather. We're heading home. Let me guess. Our shadow? Polarise the hull plating. Torpedoes. Why don't you save time and tell me what isn't down? Seal them. Get away from those men! Go. Archer to Sickbay. Report to E deck, section seven. This is an emergency. Go ahead. Bridge, report! Doctor? Will they be all right? Have you ever heard of anything like this? Are there any Vulcan records of a species that uses similar tactics? And I don't care how classified they might be. Find out what you can. Go ahead. How long before we can go to warp? What about impulse power? I'll take all the good news I can get. Keep me posted, Doctor. I'm sure they would. What? What about Echo One? Don't you ever rest? Well, I hope you get them fixed soon because you look like hell. How's it coming? Sure. Point oh six microns. At least we'll be flying home under our own power. I tried to get a message to the Vulcan High Command, but it didn't go through. If it had, we'd be expecting a Surak class ship tomorrow, oh so politely offering to help us. Maybe we should thank our visitors for blowing up the subspace amplifiers. It's holding at point oh five. You looking forward to seeing Earth? This time, we won't be leaving before we're ready. I nev I never said we didn't belong out here. I just wish we'd have launched with all our systems online, especially weapons. I keep reminding myself of that. But I rushed us out of Spacedock because I had something to prove, and I risked the lives of eighty one humans, a Vulcan, and a Denobulan to do it. Thanks. Let me know when we're ready to go to warp. My crew has managed to do in forty eight hours what would've taken the armoury team at Jupiter Station at least a week. To say that I'm proud of them would be an understatement. We're preparing our first test. Everybody has their fingers crossed, including me. You're sure there's nothing down there? Not even a microbe? I don't want to blow up something that could evolve into a sentient species in a couple of billion years. Archer to Lieutenant Reed. Have you got a lock? Let's start small. Shave a couple of metres off the top of that peak. Mister Reed, the honour is all yours. I just asked for a little off the top. What happened? Trip, T'Pol. You think that's what's causing the power surge? Activate visual sensor J-15. I assume you planted that device because you wanted to learn more about us. I'll be happy to give you a quick lesson. We're not here to make enemies, but just because we're not looking for a fight doesn't mean we'll run away from one. You may think you've left us defenceless, but let me tell you something about humans. We don't give up easily. We'll protect Enterprise any way we can. Where are they? No. Come about, and hold our position. Bridge to the Armoury. Guess who's back. Get a lock and standby. Put it through. Defenceless. Prepare to surrender your vessel. You are defenseless. Prepare to surrender your vessel. Shut it off. Mister Reed, both cannons, fire. Is that the best we can do, Lieutenant?! What about yesterday? I saw you blow something up the size of Mount McKinley. Can you overload them again? Can you overload them again? I'd rather knock out two decks than surrender this ship. Sounds good to me. We all understand the risks. Get started. Malcolm? Then fire! Torpedoes! Bridge to the Armoury. Everything okay down there? I have a feeling Their repairs are going to be a little more extensive. How'd the cannons hold up? Good work. Well, I see no reason for us to go back to Jupiter Station now. Do you? Get on it. Travis, resume our previous course. Don't get too used to drinking on duty. But you did your jobs pretty damn well yesterday. I'd say that deserves a little celebration. Permission granted. Hoshi, what can we do for you? Great, put it down right here. As long as we've got you here, Malcolm. Happy birthday. Oh, no trouble at all. Mister Reed, the honour is yours.",138

Sweet dreams.']","Good morning, everyone. Be patient. Ah! Someone had a busy night. Don't worry. I didn't forget you. Now, Let's try it without biting my fingers this time. It's nothing like that. They're from Doctor Lucas. He's a colleague from the Interspecies Medical Exchange. He's the first. He helped me get settled in when I came to San Francisco. I'm trying to return the favour. The curiosity of an explorer, even then. Oh, yes. I'm looking forward to it. If you think you're ready, we can tackle gerunds today. Dear Doctor Lucas, sorry to hear about your difficult week. I know the rigours of mating season only too well. It might help to bear in mind that a dose of niaxilin can be quite effective in separating the two combatants. It sounds like you've settled into your new living quarters. That part of the city has some very lively Kaybin bars along the river. They're open all night, if I recall. Please, don't venture inside them unescorted. They can be quite disturbing to the uninitiated. Oh, it's superficial. Only first degree burns. A little dermoline gel should do the trick. Most of my work is fairly routine. Scrapes and bruises, the occasional emergency. And you'll be pleased to hear that the crew finally seems to be growing accustomed to an alien doctor on board. I must admit, I wasn't planning to stay this long but the opportunity to observe your species on their first deep space venture has proven irresistible. Lieutenant, I saved a seat for you. It's a bit daunting at times, trying to socialise with the crew, form friendships, but our profession guarantees that sooner or later everyone comes to see us. It makes interaction quite a bit easier. It's just a little gastrointestinal distress. Well, you've been feeding him cheese again, haven't you? You've got to learn how to say no, Captain. I never thought I'd meet a species that forges such intimate bonds with lesser creatures. It's surprising the things you humans choose to invest your emotions in. No bother. He was one of my more co-operative patients today. I've noticed how the captain seems to anthropomorphise his pet. He even talks to the creature although I'm fairly certain it has no idea what he's saying. Then again, I've been known to speak to my Pyrithian bat on occasion. No, no. I'd like to stay and see what happens. No, not the film. I'm sensing a rising emotional undercurrent in the room. I'm curious to see if it culminates in some kind of group response. We had something similar a few hundred years ago, but they lost their appeal when people discovered their real lives were more interesting. I suppose it is. It's remarkable, Doctor. Even fictional characters seem to elicit human compassion. My shipmates have calmly faced any number of dangers, and yet a simple movie can bring tears to their eyes. Temporal vein. And what is the maxillary connected to? Very good. The external jugular. And that leads to? Physiologically, it is nothing more than a very efficient pump. What could possibly make you people think it is the source of all emotion? Good night. You're welcome. I'm sure I will. It's all right. I'm trying to shed some of my cultural inhibitions. Since we were on the subject of mating, I think Crewman Cutler may be romantically interested in me. I can't be certain, however. The pheromones of human females aren't as potent as Denobulans'. I detected the illness. I am. If this letter arrives later than usual, Doctor, I hope you'll forgive me. I've been presented with a rather unusual case involving a pair of alien astronauts. It may not surprise you that they landed in my Sickbay through an act of human compassion. I said before that my duties entail the occasional emergency. Emergencies, it seems, come in all shapes and sizes. I was once nearly overwhelmed by fifty patients in a refugee camp on Matalas. Captain Archer is now asking me to take responsibility for over fifty million. Their condition is grave, but they're resting for now. Your syntax is improving. Continue. The sauce is good but I don't care for this vegetable. It's a nostril? In Denobulan, please. I believe the word you're searching for is dating. I'm not exactly sure. Well, she did kiss me on the cheek the other night. Do you have any advice? I beg your pardon? The Captain has committed all our resources to helping people he didn't even know existed two days ago. Once again, I am struck by your species' desire to help others. What's the current rate of infection? You're treating them with a synthetic antibody? Captain, treatment with priaxate should ease the symptoms in the sickest patients, at least temporarily. I can easily show the Valakians how to synthesize as much as they need. I'll need all of the lab work you have, and case histories of patients in every stage of the disease. I don't see any Menk patients here. Where are they being treated? Have you looked into their immunity? Still, could be significant. I'd like to see your data on the Menk as well. I had meant to transmit this letter by now but the Valakian epidemic has been taking up most of my time. Working with the physicians here has been quite fulfilling.

You'll have the chance to see for yourself. You're a trained exobiologist. I'd find your assistance in the field invaluable.

I think this one's worth a closer look. Get the probe closer. Come in. Hoshi. Of course. What's on your mind? They have their UTs, and we'll try to keep an open comlink. Are you trying to tell me something? I never doubted that you'd find them. Your timing couldn't be better. T'Pol just asked me to assign you to the team. You'd better get to the launch bay before they leave without you. How many are there? You can't tell what happened to them? Stand by. How long is the pod's hull going to hold up? T'Pol. You've got twenty minutes to see if you can do anything for that crew, then I want you out of there. Understood? You have a margin of safety. Archer to T'Pol. What's your status? Shuttlepod One, respond. Sounds like Klingon. Set a pursuit course. Bring the grappler online. Bridge to Security. Send a team to launch bay one. Trip. The bridge is yours, Travis. Everybody all right? Archer to the Bridge. Have you still got a fix on the shipwreck? Transfer the coordinates to the launch bay. I'm going back for the boarding party. Then polarise the hull plating. We'll take Enterprise down. Archer to boarding party. Come in. How are you holding up? What's your status? Don't worry about it. We're coming to get you. Travis, how much farther? Is our probe still working? Try using it to triangulate their position. I'm afraid we've got a little hitch in our rescue plan. We'll be back for you as soon as we can. In the meantime, just sit tight. Can you do anything? I'm the Captain. From what I've noticed, that's not hard to do. You stranded three of my people down there. We didn't infect anyone. We boarded your ship to try and help. Look, I don't know what happened to your crew but we had nothing to do with it. Now your vessel is sinking deeper into the atmosphere and unless we do something, it'll be destroyed. I've got three very capable people on your ship. Let them help. If you tell them how to get the engines running, they can fly it out of there. No. Remind me to stop trying to help people. How long will it last down there? I don't think we're going to get any help from our guest in Sickbay. Get started on those braces. Keep an eye out for any Klingon ships coming this way. I think I might have made a tactical error dealing with the Klingon woman. I asked her for help. She could see that as a sign of weakness. We've run into them three times, and every time they've wanted to destroy us. I'd love to figure out why. That may not be so easy. We could use their help right now. If we can re-establish a comm. signal with T'Pol and the others, the Klingon woman could probably talk them through the repairs, but she's got a thousand generations of instinct telling her not to trust me. Go ahead. Qapla'. Success. I decided to take your advice about thinking like a Klingon. The Vulcan database has about nine hundred pages on them. Plenty. They're driven by a warrior mentality. They tend to view anyone they meet as a potential enemy. They also have a strong sense of duty. Er, Heh CHo' mruak tah. Death before dishonour. Finish up that diagnostic. I'll be in Sickbay. Something like that. Doctor Phlox has developed an antidote to the neurotoxin in your system. Have you had a drink lately? The bio-agent that affected you and your crew was consumed, apparently in alcohol. Yes? I can understand your not wanting to talk about it, if the raid went badly for you. Did your whole crew drink it? I'll take that as a yes. It was that ale that infected you, not us. Think about it. When did your crew start getting sick? Was it right after the raid?

You must know something about their culture, the kinds of food they eat, what they do for fun. Of course not. These people have never seen humans before. It makes sense for someone with a familiar face to make the introductions. Don't worry, I'll get you back in plenty of time. I just thought you might enjoy one final mission with your Captain. Or maybe I should just take you back to Enterprise. Go ahead, Trip. I got it. Did the Chancellor say anything about sending an escort? I'm taking evasive action. Bring the plasma weapons online. Fire. Houdini could get out of this. Harry Houdini was a magician, an escape artist. He was famous for being able to free himself from any kind of restraint. Rope, chains, anything. That's why he was called a magician. Some people say he was double-jointed. I don't suppose Vulcans are double-jointed. If you want answers, talk to me. That's right. I'm human, from the planet Earth. There's been a misunderstanding. We're here at the invitation of your Chancellor. It's a phase pistol. Our protein resequencer can make chicken sandwiches. A steward? Ready? Go. Easy. Come on. Go. I think we got a little higher that time. That's not frustration I hear in your voice. Good. Let's try it again. One, two, three. Ready? Go. I think these are starting to come loose. How about yours? We might be able to untie these knots. You'd think the Vulcan database might have mentioned these people were fighting a civil war. I imagine your people are going to want their database back, too. Well, they can have it. Can you reach the knot? You're not responsible for what happened. You didn't have any idea that your people had installed a listening post, or that there were Andorian commandos there. I think I understand. You're running away because you're afraid to become one of us. Then why aren't you fighting this transfer? Your people took something away from my father that meant a lot to him. They're not going to do the same thing to me. Go get his weapon. We can't eat like this. Friendly. Can you pick up yours? Dig in, Sub-commander. I don't think you'll be able to send this back for some plomeek broth. I didn't ask if you were hungry. You need to keep up your strength, so eat. That's an order. Look at this. Trip? Just the two of you? He couldn't have picked a better time. That won't be a problem. Get down. What's going on? Thanks. Seems you went to a lot of trouble to return it. Look, we're all on the same side here. Let's get her to the ship. She's still my Science Officer. Is the pod close? Let's go. I know how you must feel. She saved my life once too. She can be a real pain in the ass. Stubborn, arrogant. Sometimes she makes me angry enough, I want to shove her out an airlock. I can understand why the High Command's upset, but it took a lot of courage to step in front of that plasma bullet. Do you really want to take her back home in disgrace? I'm not asking anyone to pin a medal on her. All I'm asking is that she be given a second chance. If a respected Vulcan captain went before the High Command and made a plea on T'Pol's behalf, told them how she saved the life of a superior officer, wouldn't they think twice about this transfer? Thank you. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You were shot. Don't you remember? He's all right, thanks to you. You made quite an impression on Sopek. I've got a feeling he's going to talk to the High Command about that transfer order. I'd say the odds are pretty good you're going to be with us for a while longer. It's probably not too late if you want to catch up to him.",91

Well, with our sensor array down, we won't know when they get back until we see them. Any luck with the comm? Well, no doubt you'll have your boys take this pod apart piece by piece once it's back in the launch bay. Well, tinker all you like. I've got a copy of Ulysses here. I doubt I'll even be halfway through it by the time the ship gets back. British schools have a core curriculum. It serves to provide a well-rounded education. Sometimes I think you North Americans read nothing but comic books and those ridiculous science fiction novels. Oh, if only Doctor Cochrane had been a European. The Vulcans would have been far less reticent to help us. But, no, he had to be from Montana. He probably spent his nights reading about cowboys and Indians. Commander. Commander. I think you'd better come and take a look at this. Is it a ship? They'd be here. They only go three hundred kph. They'd be right here waiting for us to return. Commander, we have to figure out what we're going to do. With what? We have no radio. Nothing to pick up the beacons. It's offline. Ten million kilometers, maybe twenty, but I highly doubt there'd be a ship anywhere close to that. At impulse? A lot more than ten days. I'm afraid the math doesn't work out, Commander. It's going to take weeks, maybe months for our signal to reach Echo Three. By the time Starfleet got a ship out here we'd be, we'd be long dead. Sir. Which way to what? I told you, it's too far. Navigation is down. You want me to guess? Sir. I don't suppose you have a sextant handy. That blue giant, we may have gone by it. I'm not sure. Personal log, Lieutenant Malcolm Reed. November 9, 2151. By the time anyone hears this, by anyone, I suppose I mean anyone human, Commander Tucker and I will be long dead. It's my intention to recount the events that led to the destruction of the Starship Enterprise and to express my deepest feelings regarding my short but memorable service with Starfleet. short but memorable service with Starfleet. In order to test the targeting scanners on Shuttlepod one, Commander Tucker and I had to get at least twenty thousand kilometres from Enterprise. During our third trial, we experienced a brief but sizable jolt, and shortly thereafter realised that our sensor array had gone offline. that our sensor array had gone offline. We had no choice but to head back to the asteroid field where Enterprise was involved in a mapping project. We found the ship destroyed, its debris strewn across a square kilometre of one of the larger asteroids. Had our sensors been working we certainly would have done everything possible to determine the cause of the disaster, but as it was, with only a short-range distress beacon and limited air, we had no alternative but to set a course for Echo Three where someday this vessel and eventually this log, will be found. May God have mercy on our souls. What would you like me to do? If there's something you need me to do I would be more than happy to comply, but I'm afraid pessimism is simply not an accurate description of my log entry. I'm just being realistic, Commander. At warp, perhaps, but at impulse? But that's just it, sir. At impulse, we're not likely to be running into any planets. Not for at least six or seven years. I'll heat up some rations. Unless of course you'd rather wait until we run into a vessel serving proper meals. What are you in the mood for? Veal marsala. Chilean sea bass. Moo Goo Gai Pan. With gravy and mashed potatoes. Kentucky bourbon. The sea bass. It's lovely. Thank you. Captain Archer claims you told him you weren't even aware that I was serving on Enterprise. I find that difficult to believe, considering I wrote you twice in the weeks prior to our departure. Now, it is possible that you never received those letters. You were, I believe, in the process of moving back to Malaysia at the time. But you must have spoken to Aunt Sherry during that period, and I know she received my letters. I would hate to go to my death thinking that either of you felt I was trying to avoid As I'm sure you must have heard that was my esteemed colleague, Commander Charles Tucker. Mister Tucker doesn't share my belief that it is essential to say what must be said, to leave a record, tie up loose ends. Mister Tucker is labouring under the false hope that we are going to be miraculously rescued before we both suffocate. In a few days, when the reality of this situation actually begins to sink in, you might very well decide you want to record some logs of your own. You have my word, I will not interrupt you. We have less than nine days of oxygen left. It seems a waste to use it up sleeping. We're back. What happened? How did we? I'm afraid I don't understand. Sub-Commander? I'd feel a lot better if I knew what was going on. Heroics? Well, since you're obviously not going to tell me what happened I suppose a simple good night will have to do. I can't say I've ever ignored you, T'Pol. Is it all right if I call you T'Pol? I suppose so. But, if the truth be known, I've never much cared for the name Malcolm. Always seemed a bit too stuffy. Well, then, perhaps I won't change it. Pity, though. I was rather growing fond of the name Stinky. I can't believe you just did that. You smiled. I saw you smile. This one does. I saw you. It was when I said Stinky, wasn't it? You smiled when I said Stinky. Good morning, Stinky. It's a lovely day,` isn't it, Stinky? What's that? I beg your pardon? You repaired the receiver. What is that? Is it a ship? What the hell was that? We're losing atmosphere. Pressure's down eight percent. Without sensors it's not going to be easy to locate the breach. Pressure's down twenty two percent. Where is it? What are you doing? I got it. It's over here. We've got some valve sealant in storage bin three. Do you mind passing your meat loaf? I assume you've finished with it. I'm afraid it did more than just puncture the cabin, Commander. On it's way out it was kind enough to rupture one of the O2 cylinders. We've got less than two days of air left. The skin of this pod is designed to deflect a meteor five times the size of this hole. We'll never know. We have forty hours of air left. What do you expect me to do, sit here and plan my wedding? Then maybe it's your wedding we should be planning. That's assuming we can find you a bride in the next day and a half. Any suggestions? The 602 Club. I was there more times than I can remember. Ruby? You don't mean the waitress Ruby? I knew her more times than I can remember. Seems we have more in common than we thought. What are you talking about? Our last two and a half days freezing versus our last two days toasty warm. What a delightful choice. Freezing it is then. An officer at his best is always well-groomed. Actually, I was thinking about what our corpses would look like when they're eventually found. With no air in the pod, we should remain in fairly good condition. What's that? Thanks. My dearest Deborah. By this time I'm certain you've learned of the tragedy that befell the starship Enterprise. You've also undoubtedly learned that my colleague, Commander Charles Tucker, and I did manage to survive for a few days after the accident. It's during that brief time that I've chosen to correspond with you. Although our relationship was short-lived, and at times tumultuous, I can't help but picture your beautiful smile. It gives me great comfort. Think of me from time to time. Cordially, Malcolm. A ship? My dearest Rochelle. By this time I'm certain you've learned of the tragedy That's not true. There have been subtle differences. I would never refer to Rochelle as having a beautiful smile. With her, it was the eyes. If the Captain were here with us now I wonder if he'd feel guilty about bringing them on this mission. I don't remember Hoshi loving much about being in deep space. Sounds to me like you do have some letters to record. You know, your treacly optimism is beginning to get just a little bit tiresome. At least I'm capable of accepting our fate. We're going to be dead in about thirty three33 hours. Whether our beards continue to grow or not is of no concern to me. We will be dead! And unless some ship happens to cross our path, our bearded bodies will be discovered in about three or four years. Is that optimistic enough for you? What's your problem with facing the truth? I'm not hungry. I don't drink on duty. Do you really think that's going to provide any heat? You know that's going to consume oxygen, don't you? Is that really how you see me? The eternal pessimist? The grim reaper? I don't want to die. What makes you think I want to die? I lost nearly everyone I cared about on that ship. Those girls I talked about. Rochelle, Deborah, Catelin. None of them worked out because I could never get very close to them. Never got very close to my family either, for that matter, not that it's any business of yours. But with the crew of the Enterprise, it was different. I was really starting to feel comfortable with them, and now the only one that's left thinks I'm the bloody angel of death. Does that sound modulated enough for you? The radio. Or is it just the galaxy giggling at us again? You know, it's funny. I was just beginning to think that Captain Archer was invincible, you know? Just serving on the same starship as him made me feel safe for some reason. He had a knack for getting us out of trouble, didn't he. Clear my mask? The Captain? I can't imagine why you'd have a problem with that. And who was that? A moray eel? Are you out of your mind. So? That must have been the last time the Captain ever went diving with you. Hey, what do you think of T'Pol, hmm? Do you think she's pretty? Well, she's a woman, you know? I think she's pretty. Don't tell me you've never looked at her, you know, in that way. Well, I think she's pretty. You ever noticed her bum? Her bum. She's got an awfully nice bum. Awfully nice! It's probably nothing, right? Well then, that means it's something. What is it? Well, is it something or someone, because if it's someone Sorry. We have no way to respond, do we. This is like the plane flying over the desert island in a lost-at-sea movie. Sorry. Happy endings. I must think happy endings. Don't be so pessimistic. It's not impossible. It's Hoshi. They're okay. Enterprise is okay. It's Hoshi! Rendezvous. What a beautiful word. What's wrong? And we only have a little more than one day's air left. Yes, not that it matters. They're probably travelling at what, warp two, warp three? Compared to them, we're like a garden snail. Where we go and how fast we get there is irrelevant. How much? An hour's worth? Great. So when they reach us in two days we'll have been out of air for eleven hours. You ever try holding your breath for eleven hours? Enterprise is going to wonder why we haven't responded, right? Maybe they'll be concerned and increase their speed. Can they see us on their sensors? Then we've got to get that blip to tell them to pick up a little steam. What if we fired our weapons? What if we jettison the impulse drive? Well, you could rig a self-destruct. I imagine that would make quite an explosion. Maybe even big enough to make that blip do something odd. What's the difference between that and travelling at a snail's pace? Then I'll ask you again. Ever hold your breath for eleven hours? How does it feel to be slower than a snail? Fine. Less than twelve hours, you win. More than twelve and it's mine. Go check the pressure gauge. I can't believe we've been sitting here that long. Ten hours. The whiskey's yours. Now, why don't you give us a toast before you drink it? Great idea. Why don't you climb up into the airlock and seal yourself in. Any last words you want me to pass along? What are you doing? You're crazy. Now get down from there! If anyone should go up in there, it should be me. You're the Chief Engineer. Commander. It's set to stun. I don't want to use it, but I will. Go to hell! What would you know about being a hero? It takes nothing but a coward to crawl up inside a hole to die. Be my guest. I could use a little less responsibility. Now, get down here. Your Armoury Officer, and perhaps your friend. You know, I'm not a doctor, but I'm pretty sure you use up a lot more oxygen when you shout like that! That's exactly what I'm saying. If there's one chance in a thousand that they saw our impulse drive explode, that they increased their speed, I'll take that chance. I've invested far too much time trying to figure you out, Mister Tucker. I'm not about to accept that it was all for nothing. We're back. How did? The Commander. You must have seen the explosion. You don't say. We saw debris from Enterprise on one of the asteroids. We assumed, we thought you were all. Sub-Commander. Isn't there something you're supposed to say to me? Heroics. Something about heroics. Trip?",166

Well, if this little trip is a death sentence, then it would seem to me we're entitled to a last meal. What'll it be? I'm afraid our selection is somewhat limited. Well, then how about a drink? Are you serious? We're dead men, remember? What's the matter, Lieutenant? Are you afraid the autopsy will show your blood-alcohol level was too high to pilot a shuttle? ( Live a little. That's an order. The bourbon'll provide the heat. The candle's just for mood. To the brave men and women of the starship Enterprise. We'll probably be dead five or six minutes earlier than we would have been. I can live with that. Anyway, it seems to me as far as you're concerned, the sooner the better. Because ever since we saw Enterprise spread across that asteroid, you've done nothing but write your own obituary. All of a sudden, five or six more minutes sounds kind of nice. Modulated? It can giggle all it wants, but the galaxy's not getting any of our bourbon. Yeah, he's always been that way. When I first taught him to dive, it really got on my nerves. He'd come down to the Keys at least once a month, and whatever it was I was teaching him, he'd get it the first time. Did you ever try clearing your mask? Everybody's got to do it before they get certified. You go down and the instructor fills your mask with water, and you have to clear it by blowing out through your nose. Nobody likes to do it. Got it the first time. Filled it with water a second time just so he could clear it again. I took him on a night dive once into some caves I'd been to a hundred times before, and for some reason I got a little lost. So what does Archer do? He swims ahead of me and finds a way out. I was the instructor. I'd been diving all my life. Then big Mister Starfleet comes down and does everything faster and better than I could. That's when I decided to introduce him to old Waldo. A green moray. It's said he's thirty years old. Must've been two and a half metres long. So I took the Captain into Waldo's hole. Told him there was some beautiful starfish inside, and he reached in. Damned if old Waldo didn't take hold of his forearm. I was breaking just about every rule in the book, but he was wearing titanium mesh. I figures the worst thing that could happen would be that Waldo would scare him a little. He deserved to have the piss taken out of him. No such luck. He pulled Waldo clear out of the hole. I don't think I'd ever seen that eel's tail before. He found some pressure point under it's lower jaw, right about here. Waldo just let go. Went back down his hole. That's the thing. He found it all funnier than I did. He took me out to dinner that night. Steaks, lobsters, Kentucky bourbon. T'Pol? Are you serious? You've had too much to drink. Nah, she's a Vulcan. Oh, God. What? To Sub-Commander T'Pol. It's definitely not nothing. Shush! Definitely someone. Malcolm! That's Hoshi! That's impossible! They're still two days away. And no way to tell them to get here sooner. Are you sure you got the coordinates right? Lieutenant. If I purge the CO2 filters it'll give us a little more air. Probably less. A train leaves New York at three a.m. heading west, while another leaves Chicago at four thirty heading east. I never could figure those out. Maybe, but if we really want to get them to go to high warp we're going to have to attract their attention. Something a little more dramatic than not answering their hails. Two days away at warp three? Oh, they can see us, maybe not too clearly, but we should be a nice little blip on T'Pol's viewer. They're nearly a quarter of a light year away. Our plasma cannons have a range of less than ten kilometres. It would all still look like a single blip. It's going to take a lot more than that. What good would that do? No, I can't blow up our engine. We'd be adrift, dead in space. I'm an engineer. I won't blow up our only engine. I think I have some micro-detonators in here somewhere. I saw a great cartoon once. There were these two snails sitting on the back of a big old turtle and one snail turns to the other and says 'Hold on, Fred. Here we go'. If I'm right, I get the rest of the bourbon. You check it. I don't think I can move my legs. Come on, let's hear it. How much air's left? That's probably the last bet I'll ever make, and I won. I should feel like celebrating, shouldn't I? Ten hours for two men. If there were only one of us he'd have twenty hours, wouldn't he? That's just what I was thinking. Yeah. Tell Captain Archer that it was one hell of an honour serving with him. We don't know whether or not they saw our little display of pyrotechnics, but either way this'll double your chances. Sit down, Lieutenant. I'm also in charge of deciding who's going into this airlock. Do I make myself clear? What are you going to do? Kill me? Put it down! Stop trying to be a hero. It doesn't suit you. Then go ahead and shoot me, but you better hope we don't make it, because if we survive the first thing I'm going to do is bust your ass back to Crewman Second Class for insubordination. Who the hell do you think you are? Friends don't shoot each other! So what are you saying? That you'd rather have Enterprise find the two of us dead in here?",145

Earth. I've got lady friends back there, but nobody special, if that's what you mean. Not anymore. What about your world? Kantare? Well, as soon as we get your engines fixed you'll be going back, seeing your friends. I bet you're looking forward to that. We're getting there. I've worked on something like this. On a Xyrillian ship. I can try. I'll need some diagnostic gear from Enterprise. Why don't you come along? I could buy you lunch. You've been marooned for three years. A change of scenery for an hour or two couldn't hurt. Okay. I'll be back before you know it. Eighty three. Mostly. You met T'Pol. She's a Vulcan. And Doctor Phlox is from a planet called Denobula. Are you kidding? I'd never hear the end of it if I didn't introduce you. And there's Porthos, Captain Archer's dog. Oh, I guess you don't have a word for that. He's a mammal. Four legs, big ears, kind of cute. Not much. He's the Captain's pet. Well, I hope you'll have some time left for me. So, tell me about Kantare. Our mission's really just getting started. We haven't been to many planets yet. No idea. That's the fun part. If I had choose right now, I'd say this one. Go ahead. On my way. Billy, could you continue this lady's tour? I still owe you lunch. I'll meet you in the mess hall. Did T'Pol say something? Sir, I swear I've been nothing but a perfect gentleman. Oh. Strange behaviour? What's going on? They already told us what happened. What kind of an accident? Maybe that data module was damaged during the crash. That doesn't make any sense. Why wouldn't Liana have told me? It's Shilat, Captain. I saw him on their ship an hour ago. Alive. Vanilla, huh? Oh, hundreds. I like Rocky Road. I never really thought about it. I guess because it's got nuts in it. It's also got marshmallows but I don't think that's got anything to do with the name. They're little, er. They're made of sugar, mostly. You know, I'm not sure what they are. Anyway, did you enjoy the tour? I'm sorry. Something important came up. Liana, how long have you been on this planet? I want you to tell me. Because our scans show your ship crashed twenty two years ago. That's what I told Captain Archer. I said there wasn't any reason for you to lie to us. Is there? We found one of your escape pods. Liana. There was a body in it. Been dead for a long time. It was Shilat. Can you explain that to me? Tell me what's going on. Is that what you really want? How old were you when your ship crashed. Five, six? Do you even remember what your home looks like? Where's T'Pol? I'm going to need her help. I'm not doing a thing until I see her. What's so important about this thing? You'd really kill us to keep it running? I don't care what your big secret is. It doesn't matter if you've been here three years or thirty. But you've got to think about Liana. We can help you take her home. You got a lot to learn about making friends. That's a pretty neat trick. Here you are watching me with a gun in your hand while at the same time your corpse is up on the Enterprise. What do you do for an encore? Then why don't you ask them to let me go? Maybe you could tell me how I'm being guarded by a dead man. That's why your father needs to keep this running. You can stop this. Liana, please. If you don't, my friends could die. Please. They were holograms. She deserves more. And when you're gone? Are you going to let her bury you out in the hills, and live the rest of her life with these people you created? What if the relays burn out again? Then she'll really be alone. What if she gets hurt? What do you do then? Programme a holographic doctor? Maybe you have. Ask Liana how she feels. Ask her if just surviving is enough. How's it going? That was fast. It's a protein resequencer. I figured you must be tired of eating the same food all the time. I programmed it for making ice-cream. Only five flavours, but they're good ones. You didn't think I'd send you off without Rocky Road. Are you sure you don't want us to stay for a while, lend a hand? So do you. Maybe I'll see you out there.",118

Thank you for lunch. Hey! It was just a misunderstanding. I know, I know. it's a big problem with me. I'm just too damn curious. Whenever I meet new people I can't resist trying to get to know them. I'm certainly getting to know a lot about the Suliban around here. I'll do my best. Unless you have any more advice? I wouldn't know. You'd have to talk to my superiors. What exactly do you want? You've got plenty of Suliban here. Why not ask them? Then why are they in prison? There are families here, children. One man hasn't seen his wife in years. They don't deserve this kind of treatment. Oh, really? Then why not just let them find another place to live? I've met a few Suliban who disagree. Most of the people we meet have been pretty eager to get to know us but we've had our share of unfortunate encounters. I guess you could say this is one of them. What about you? What did you do before you ended up here? I've got a feeling we could be here for awhile. I don't like being strong-armed, and I don't like what he's doing to you and the others. Has anyone every tried to get out of here? Docking bay? What happened? They might have succeeded with a little help from the outside. It won't be long before Enterprise comes looking for Mayweather and me. Have you asked them? How many ships are in that docking bay? What took you so long? More or less. It's not what you think. Are you sure this is a secure frequency? Good. Where are you? Hang on, Trip. We're not ready to leave just yet. Those Suliban you detected are prisoners too, but they're no more guilty than we are. I want to help them get out of here. Have you ever heard of Manzanar, Sub-Commander? It's not a planet. It was an internment camp On Earth during the Second World War. Japanese-American citizens were imprisoned there even though they didn't do anything wrong. The same thing's happening here. In this case, I'm making an exception. Understood? I've met a Suliban who knows this camp inside and out. We've been working on a plan but we're going to need your help. We'll need a few of your people. Anyone who's had experience with particle weapons. Enterprise can handle them. We're not working for the Tandarans. I hope the others were more enthusiastic. Well, he's about this tall, a little on the scrawny side, bad teeth. You should check your sensors. They're obviously malfunctioning. It's good to see you, Malcolm. This isn't about my rights. It's about theirs. What makes you think they'll join the Cabal? I haven't been here very long but I seem to know these people a hell of a lot better than you do. Archer to Enterprise. We're on our way. Where are those patrol ships? And the Suliban? Good work. We'll see you in a few minutes. Do I think they'll get out of Tandaran space safely? Yes. Do I think they'll be all right?",92

What makes you think we're suffering from a lack of sexual activity? Why are you suddenly so curious about this? And you think that we need our tensions eased? We've all gone about ten months without a break. I think it's normal for people to get a little sloppy. Is it populated? Don't say she didn't warn you. I think I'm going to pass. Nobody needs this as much as you do. The ship will be nice and quiet. I've got some astrometric surveys that have been piling up. It'll be a good chance to get some work done. You think I need a massage? I suppose I could read those surveys on a nice beach. Transfer it to my Ready room. If you don't mind my asking, Admiral, why is this our problem? Do they expect us to take her all the way back to Vulcan? Any idea what the emergency is? Imagine that. Hoshi, thanks for giving up your cabin. Everything set? Don't address the ambassador unless spoken to first. Don't offer to shake hands. Refrain from laughing in her presence. You seem to be pulling out all the stops. Well, she'll be here soon enough. Let me know if you need any help. Someone's in a hurry. I'm Jonathan Archer. That's why we're here. If you'll transmit your landing coordinates to us, we'll send down a shuttlepod. I'm looking forward to the visit. They said it was important we pick up the ambassador as quickly as possible. They didn't say why. Ambassador. On behalf of my crew I'd like to welcome you aboard Enterprise. May I take that? This is Commander Charles Tucker, my Chief Engineer. And this is my Science Officer, Sub-Commander T'Pol. I hope you like your quarters, Ambassador. T'Pol tried very hard to anticipate your needs. T'Pol tells me you negotiated the first territorial accords between Vulcan and Andoria. T'Pol. Of course not. T'Pol. Is there a problem I should be aware of? You were a bit abrupt with her. I don't pretend to understand Vulcans. I never have. But I wouldn't be a very good captain if I didn't know when something was bothering my science officer. Uncommon, but not unheard of. We don't know what she's done. You seem to know a lot about her. Was it worth the trip? I've had a few heroes in my life. It's never easy when one of them lets you down. No, I'm sure they don't. On my way. Let's find out who they are. What can we do for you? We weren't told. What's the change of plans? Your magistrate seemed in a big hurry to get rid of her. Now he wants her back? I'll have to contact my superiors. I'm just a starship captain. You don't think they'd trust me to make these kinds of decisions on my own? Get me Starfleet Command. Just a transport captain. Polarise the hull plating. What the hell is he doing? Hail him. Aft torpedoes. Return fire. Would the phase cannons be more effective? What do you mean, we can't fire them at warp? Drop to impulse. Deploy the aft cannon. Fire. See what you can do about their engines. Resume course, warp four. Any idea what that was all about? Well, I think we know someone who might. We were asked to pick you up and deliver you to a Vulcan ship. No one said anything about getting shot at. Then who sent them? How much greater could it get? A few more volleys from that ship would have ruptured our hull. So am I. You're leaving me no choice, Ambassador. Archer to Mayweather. Change of plans, Travis. Lay in a course back to Mazar.

Something wrong? Go on. Any luck? I don't doubt that, but it doesn't affect my decision. She told you that? Which is? I'm sorry T'Pol, but I'm going to need more than that. By who? But you believed her? Why? It happens all the time. You're asking me to put the lives of everyone on board in jeopardy based on your talking to this woman for a couple of hours. Why didn't we see them coming? And go three against one? You're familiar with the Mazarites. What's their top speed? Then let's give them a run for their money.

You still haven't told me what this mission is. You hadn't even met us. And a century of good behaviour hasn't changed your mind? And that would include you. And that job fell to you? Why couldn't you tell us? And the story of you being recalled in disgrace? Obviously, it didn't work. I appreciate you telling me the truth. It hasn't gotten to that yet. If you've learned anything about humans, you'd know we don't always take the most logical course of action. What's our status? Open a channel. What do you want? So are yours. I have a better idea. Why don't you slow down before your engines explode? I've been ordered to deliver her safely to the Vulcans, and that's exactly what I plan to do. Archer to Engineering.

Okay, what else? No problem. What kind of vegetables? Hey, vegetables? Dessert? Geography. Do you know how to play? You know, you say Amazon River, which ends in an R and then I say Rhode Island. No. No, it's a game. You're supposed to tell me some place that starts with a D. No, no, don't tell me. I know an X. Xanadu. It doesn't matter. You just used an alien planet, Draylax.

The Stealth Cruiser, Lieutenant. Nothing else. Trip? You follow the instructions? Go ahead. Have Mister Mayweather locate a binary system two point five light years away and set a course. Let's get these mounted on the grappler arms. Head for the smaller star, then the inner moon of the second planet. Bridge to Armoury. Have you plotted all the target points? Stand by. I'll meet you two in the launch bay. If this goes well, I shouldn't be long. Lower the beacons. Modify the viewscreen. Bring up these coordinates. Full magnification. Activate the beacons. Right where they're supposed to be. They can see us, but they have no idea we can see through their cloak. Just keep on the same course, Travis. Malcolm? Now, Mister Reed. Archer here. That last shot should have sealed off the two lower decks. If Daniels is right, there shouldn't be more than twenty Suliban for us to deal with. Go. Here. Go. Archer to Reed. We need some help here. Go. What's the problem? Ignite the thrusters. Go to full power. Archer to Mayweather. Set a course back ward the Vulcan ship. Go to warp four as soon as we're aboard. Hoshi? I can't believe how close they got. Just long enough to attach this and cloak it. Good work. Keep at it. Get me Admiral Forrest. It's all on three data discs we took from a cloaked Suliban Cruiser. I've got friends in high places. Thank you for believing in us, Admiral. Archer out. It was ten months ago. He brought me back ten months, but I knew everything I know now. How is that possible? Well, good for the Vulcan Science Directorate. Maybe they can tell me how I woke up yesterday knowing exactly where that Suliban ship was, or how I suddenly had the ability to construct a quantum beacon to see through its cloak. And while they're at it, they might as well tell me how I knew where to find those discs. Why don't you give me another explanation? Because there isn't one. I got a call from Trip, something about inspection pods. It was the exact same call I got the day before they found Klaang. Word for word. Listen. I never thought this was possible, either, but I travelled through time and I need you to believe me. Because it's hard enough trying to fathom all this without having my Science Officer, a colleague who I trust and rely on, the person who got me to stop feeling sorry for myself, accusing me of being an hallucinating madman. Yes? What's the problem? Looks okay to me. Load torpedoes, and stand by all weapons. Deploy the beacons, Travis. Modify the Viewscreen and aim the beacons aft. Swing them down slowly. Charge the phase cannons. Put it through. Malcolm? How many could you take out? What do you want with me? How do I know you won't destroy Enterprise either way? I'm placing you in command. I advise you to maintain your present course and speed. I don't know what's going to happen, but try to keep an open mind. Especially when it comes to things the Vulcan Science Directorate says are impossible. T'Pol's in command now, Trip. Do whatever you n to help her. That goes for all of you. Keep an eye on Porthos for me, would you? Remember, no cheese. Where am I? Where is here? You said the Suliban wouldn't follow us, that we'd make it safely to the Vulcan ship.

Are you telling me that Enterprise didn't cause that explosion? He brought me back ten months, but I knew everything I know now. How is that possible? The Suliban destroyed that colony. We're going back to get proof. If bringing me here caused this, then send me back. I'll take my chances with Silik. And now, the conclusion. If this place was destroyed as long ago as it seems to have been, then what are you doing here? You and your watchdog buddies don't exactly fit in with all this. Try me. Listen, I realise your little utopia is gone, and I sympathise, but if you're telling me the truth, if you've brought me eight hundred years into the future, into this future, I think I deserve some answers. What's wrong? What's gone? Why is that a problem? Who did it commemorate? Then what? But it will? Fine. Keep your missing monument to yourself. Where's this library you were talking about? Well, there are. So, I suggest we use some of them to figure out what you did to the last thousand years when you brought me here this morning. I haven't found a single reference to this Federation you talked about. Because that monument wasn't there? So I disappear one day and all history changes? There were a lot of people involved in the Warp Five programme. The Romulan Star Empire. What's that? I don't get it. What could I have done that could have been so important? This timeline, the one you say no longer exists. What can you tell me about it if my mission had continued? And? Okay, what about this Federation? Was Earth part of it? Was I part of it? You've lost me. Sounds like you've got a chicken-or-the-egg problem. You said your time portals are gone. All your technology. There isn't even electricity here. You going to find a bicycle, turn it into a time machine? And my scanner. You can't do that with those. What are we waiting for? I can't be sure, but I think that's copper. Any luck? I thought you built these things in high school. Why is the same day so important? What would be wrong with making contact a week before I left or even a month before? This is Captain Archer. Can you hear me? T'Pol, this is Captain Archer. Can you hear me? I don't think it's working. You don't know where who is? Sub-Commander, this is Captain Archer. I'm having trouble understanding you. Daniels brought me to the future. That's what the temporal reading was all about. Are you all right? Whatever you say. Just tell me, are you all right? Where are you? No, I mean Enterprise. Where's Enterprise? T'Pol, listen to me. I need your help. You're going to have to find a way to get to Daniels' quarters. Do you understand me? There's no technology where I am. T'Pol, do you remember when I asked you to keep an open mind? There's a lot more at stake here than bringing me back, or the mission. I need you to listen to me very carefully. I need you to trust me. I said, you're an ugly bastard. You try shape-shifting on me, or pulling one of your chameleon routines and I promise you, Silik, I'll blow your head off. Has Enterprise left the nebula? Where's my ship, Silik? How many Cell ships did you send after them? Silik! You're going to call them off, and then you're going to give me those data discs back. Now get up. Shut up. Get going. Go ahead, Enterprise. Good to hear yours, too. I feel like I've been away for a thousand years. Is everyone all right? I know it's not standard Starfleet procedure But I took a hostage. By the time he wakes up, we'll be long gone. Request permission to dock. It may see somewhat implausible to you, but When I was in my early twenties on a trip to East Africa I saw a gazelle giving birth. It was truly amazing. Within minutes the baby was standing up, standing up on its own. A few more minutes and it was walking and before I knew it, it was running alongside its mother, moving away with the herd.

I wasn't sure what you wanted for breakfast, so I took the liberty of having Chef prepare his famous Eggs Benedict. You plan to eat standing up? This isn't a visit to the principal's office, Malcolm. At ease. No. No business. I just wanted to have a long overdue meal with my Armoury Officer. I heard that England made it to the finals in the World Cup. The World Cup? Soccer? Any sports you do follow? Thanks. Didn't your mother ever tell you not to bring your homework to the table? This looks fine. Archer. Take us out of warp. I'm on my way. Looks like we'll have to reschedule. Anybody home? What about geographical features? Anything interesting? Well, I don't know about anyone else, but I could use some fresh air. Put us in a standard orbit. Find a volcano with a gentle slope. Preferably one that's not erupting. Prep a shuttlepod, Travis. We'll take shifts down to Report! Emergency bulkheads? Was anybody in them? Find out what happened. Malcolm! Archer to Engineering. I was hoping you could tell me. Nothing on our sensors. How are your people? Keep me posted. Archer out. Any casualty reports? Can you get a visual? There. Just behind the secondary plasma vent. You see it? It's too small. Can you tell if it's active? What if we polarised the adjacent hull plating? I've never heard of a minefield with just two mines. Are the quantum beacons still mounted on the grappler arm? Lower them into position, then modify the viewscreen. Activate the beacon. How bad is it? Trip, I'm not sure Malcolm's going to be able to defuse this thing. Couldn't we just detach that section of hull plating? Let it drift away? How long? Get a team started. I'll consider it our last resort. We see it, Malcolm. Ever see a ship like that? Why didn't the beacons let us see through its cloak? Archer to Sickbay. Is Hoshi in any shape to return to the Bridge? It's urgent. Understood. Any luck? Not a very subtle warning shot. Can you get us out of here? We'll give you whatever help we can. Bridge to Lieutenant Reed. Our friends seem to be anxious for us to leave. We're going to break orbit, nice and slowly. I'll try to remember. Maneuvering thrusters only. Activate the beacon. That doesn't mean they're not still close. Go ahead. How good a theory? I've got Trip working on a backup plan, but I'd prefer not to use it. Right now, you're our best bet. Be careful, Malcolm. Go ahead. What about it? Is there a problem? I'm on my way, Lieutenant. The Bridge is yours. That's why I need you here, Trip. Thought you might need a hand. Let's see what we can do with the one you got. Could have been worse. It missed the bone, and it looks like the pressure from the spike is keeping the wound from bleeding too much. You'll be in Sickbay in no time. These should cut right through it. Not without doing more damage to that leg. I intend to save both. That backup plan I was telling you about? I asked Trip to prepare to detach this section of hull plating. Seemed like a good idea at the time. Not with you attached to it. Phlox's own recipe. I don't want you too sedated. I'm going to need your help. Someone's got to defuse this thing. You're going to talk me through it. I'm a quick study. In case you haven't noticed, Lieutenant we're sitting about five metres from an impulse reactor. I'm not leaving until we take this weapon offline. The way I see it, you don't have much choice. You're sort of stuck here. So would you let me get started? Romulans? I read about them when I was with Daniels. Not much. Just the name. He wouldn't let me see anything else. T'Pol? That's going to be a little tough to do at the moment. Is there any way you can explain our situation? We've taken two of the detonation circuits offline. Three more to go. Keep me posted. There's six of them. So, where were we? This morning, at breakfast, before we were interrupted. You said you didn't follow any particular sport. How about hobbies? Any hobbies? I could've sworn I've seen you reading a book or two in the mess hall. It helps me focus. It calms my nerves. Sorry. It made you a little nervous this morning, too, didn't it? Why is that? Never too late to learn. I had a CO once felt the same way. They're your crew, not your friends. I thought about that a lot when I took this command, but then I realised this is not your typical mission. We could be out here for years. All we have to depend on is each other. I appreciate your suggestions, Malcolm. Anything else? What's the point of having a senior staff if they just sit around with their mouths shut? I'm glad they have opinions. I rely on them. Keep going. I'm aware of your concerns in that area. Ah ha. You're talking in the past tense, Lieutenant. Thanks. Go ahead. Maintain course and speed. How do we do that? You must have realised this wasn't going to be your typical armory posting. That my command style lacked a certain spit and polish. Strange. I understand you came from a long line of Royal Navy men. Your father, your grandfather. Why pick Starfleet? Why not continue the family tradition? What happened? So, what happened? Grow out of what? You're afraid of the water? So instead of a life on the sea you chose a life in the vacuum of space? The one with aquaphobia? Talk about facing your deepest fears. I don't think I do. You were telling me about the Clement. I appreciate what you're trying to tell me, Malcolm, but I was hoping you'd be able to save your heroics for another time. Got you. I said I heard you, Lieutenant. What? What is it? I won't tell a soul. T'Pol, report. I'm defusing the last detonation circuit. Stand by. Lieutenant? How can we get to it? Show me that sub-detonator. I thought you were afraid of the water.

So I can't ignore it, and I can't talk about it. What do you suggest I do? If Porthos pulls through, will he need a special diet or treatments having a chameleon's pituitary gland? You're kidding.

I didn't think your shift began until oh nine hundred. Just a courtesy? Ensign, will you join me? Have a seat. You've read the list? She told me. The last part, just before the end, that little expression that gets repeated. Do you know what I'm talking about? Their pronunciation guide doesn't make any sense. I'm going to need some help. Come in. Sub-Commander. Did he tell you they gave us two spares out of the kindness of their hearts? Since I've been getting so much practice giving apologies I thought I might give you one. Yeah, it is. I've been under a lot of stress lately, haven't gotten much sleep. My dog Whatever friction there's been between us, I'd like to try to minimise it. I guess that's always been true. Especially when the people are of the opposite sex. I promise. I doubt I would have even gone down, there if it hadn't been for you, Doc. I owe you one. The transplant? Can I see him? Hey.

We tried to hail you, but there was no response. That must make it difficult to do business. A Kreetassan merchant told us this was a deuterium facility. Our supply will be gone in less than two weeks. I apologise, but when you didn't respond to our hails. You sure you couldn't spare a few hundred litres? It seems that there might be an opportunity for us to help each other. We can't spare that many. Maybe three. Actually, no. I'd enjoy seeing how your facility works. Four power cells and whatever medical supplies we can spare. Commander Tucker and his team will do the best they can. Agreed. You've been to other colonies that trade deuterium, haven't you? Are they all this rustic? Their equipment's falling apart. Half these structures look like they're about to collapse. Phlox tells me they don't even have basic medical supplies. Deuterium is a highly valuable commodity. You'd think these people would be better off. Then why do they need us to finish fixing their pumps in two days? What's the hurry? Archer to Enterprise. Have the Klingons detected Enterprise yet? Travis, adjust your orbit. Keep Enterprise out of sight. So this is your exclusive arrangement? Maybe there's something we can do. Mister Reed. We'll be at the landing site. Come in. So that's it? We just take our deuterium and leave? They work their asses off to provide for their families and then the Klingons just stroll in and rob them blind. Does that seem right to you? Malcolm tells me that Klingon ship isn't much more than a freighter. I'd lay odds they're no match for Enterprise. We could try to contact the Klingon High Council. We saved Klaang from the Suliban, we pulled one of their battle cruisers out of a gas giant. I say they owe us a favour. I already know where Vulcans stand on interfering with other cultures but this isn't a culture. Seventy six settlers are being preyed upon. If this were an Earth colony I'd be grateful if someone showed up to give me a hand. I just hate the idea of turning our backs. Need a hand? Okay. This one? Sometimes I have a bad habit of overstaying my welcome. Seems to me this crawler's the least of your problems. You said they've been coming here for what, five seasons? How much longer do you plan on letting this go on? Another five? I had a talk with my tactical officer. We're confident you have the ability to defend yourselves. It would be different this time. We would help you prepare. There's a saying on my world. Give a man a fish and he eats for a day. Teach him to fish, and he eats for a lifetime. You're going to lure them into a trap. That's where deception and surprise come in. Did you bring the map I asked you for? The structures in the colony, they're mostly modular, right? So you're saying you could relocate these buildings in a relatively short time. About fifty metres to the south, right here. They'll have to be capped off, and camouflaged. We've got three days. We should get to work. Thanks. How are things going with the pumps? Let me know. I got it. If you need more people. I thought taking the town apart was tough. But putting it back together. Do you think it's a mistake? I've never liked bullies, Trip. Not on Earth and not out here. We had a little trouble moving one of the pumps, but it's in place now. We're ready.

Matter of security? You didn't answer my question. What kind of matter of security? They're sending you to get somebody. Somebody you'll be handing over to the Vulcans. Why you? Thanks for being so enlightening. Dismissed. Did you find the co-ordinates? Set a course. When we arrive, you'll be piloting the shuttlepod. Somewhere in the Pernaia System, no doubt. As far as the exact location, Admiral Forrest doesn't even know that. It seems the Sub-Commander's on a highly classified mission. No, we're supposed to wait at Pernaia Prime for T'Pol and Travis to finish their mission. It's only for a few days. We've got plenty to keep ourselves busy. Is there anything specific you and Travis are going to need? Come in. If the Vulcan High Command doesn't approve of the water polo match I'm watching, I'd be happy to find another. What can I do for you? Move over, Porthos. Let the lady sit down. Sounds like this is going to be good. Come on, sit down. How long ago are we talking about? Go ahead. They're close allies with the Vulcans, right? You're not going to tell me you're one of those agents. I guess even Vulcans can fall prey to temptation. So tomorrow you get to pick up number six. Why couldn't someone else do it? Why you? How very Vulcan. So, why have you decided to tell me all this? What? You said there's a Vulcan ship coming. I'm sure they can provide all the assistance you'll need. Why? What's his name? The man we're going to apprehend. See you in the morning. We'll be back in three to five days, Trip. If that Vulcan ship comes snooping around, the last thing you want to tell them is that I'm with T'Pol. Three to five days, Trip. She's got some unfinished business, Trip. I'm not sure why, but she needs me to go along. We'll be okay. You're in charge, Commander. Have you given Travis the coordinates? Why didn't he want to come home? Smuggling what? You never found him? They? What happened? T'Pol? Where? If he sees T'Pol, he may try to get to his ship. Which way? I couldn't agree more. Do you have somewhere we can put him until we leave? Any one of these people could be working with him. Why should she believe a fugitive and not her own government? If you're innocent, I'm sure you'll be given a chance to defend yourself. We're here to take you to Vulcan. No one's going to shoot you. T'Pol! What are you doing? T'Pol? Where the hell are you going? T'Pol! But the platform's covered with acid! That wasn't too smart. You could have been hurt. What did you find? You'll have to go through decon when we get back. Come on, Travis. Let's see if we can find something to eat. Where's Menos? Get back over there. What happened? Seven what? I don't understand. But you fired first? How? No. And you had this. This Fullara ritual performed? Why would you feel guilty if this Jossen was about to fire at you? When did it start coming back? That doesn't make any sense. What's Menos been telling you? What's he been telling you? And you claim you're a peaceful man. T'Pol! Refasten them. Travis! Come on. Where's his ship? Your mission is to return him to Vulcan, not determine whether he's guilty or innocent. Where's his ship? Let's be sure. We'll all need to go through decon now. Was that the only way in? Go back to the cockpit, Travis. Get life support fired up if you can. It's pretty cold. He should've gotten here before us. This ship shouldn't be here.

How close can we get? How long would it take to reach the system at impulse? Set a course. Trip. If you've got some free time, I'd love it if you take a look at my chair. The Captain's chair. You may have noticed that I don't sit in it very much. It's uncomfortable. When I lean back I feel like I'm about to slide out of it. I have to sort of perch on the edge. Take a look at it for me? The chair first, if you don't mind. Come in. Morning. No, no. Just thinking about something. Thanks. I'll drop by the Armoury. Anything else? Is it serious? If it's all right with Chef. Let me ask you a question. I received a manuscript from Earth. A biography of my father. I've been asked to write the preface. Would you mind reading it when I'm done? If I can ever get it finished. I've been putting it off for weeks. It's not that I haven't had the time. They only asked for a page. How am I supposed to sum up my father's life in a page? It would've been easier if they'd asked me to write the book. A logical approach. Maybe you'd like to write it for me? You asked to see me, Malcolm? It's no problem. What's on your mind? And you have a proposal? I appreciate your concern, Malcolm, but this isn't a warship. I can see that. Run this by the senior officers, get some feedback, and we'll talk again. And Malcolm, don't call it battle stations. Think of something less aggressive. When I was about eight years old, my father took me on a tour of the Warp Five facility outside of Bozeman, Montana. He introduced me to the people he worked with. Scientists with names like Tasaki and Cochrane. At the time, I didn't realise the significance of those names or the significance of my father's work. Computer, pause. I'll feed you in a minute. Computer, resume recording. In a way, creating a stable warp field mirrored the, the flux of emotions my father felt when he embarked on. Computer, pause. Delete the last paragraph. Hell, delete the whole thing. Quiet. What happened to my chair? Is that why you called me down here? Isn't that used for aligning phase coils? As long as I'm down here, maybe I can get your opinion. How does one measure a man's legacy? Is it defined by the works he's created, the technological advances that will forever alter the course of human history? If so, then no man since Zephram Cochrane, himself has made a more lasting contribution to the future of humankind than my father, Doctor Henry Archer. What do you think? Let me read you the rest. It's just a few more pages. Nineteen. I've got a lot to say. What's that supposed to mean? You're lucky you're a decent engineer because you obviously don't know anything about writing. Where's lunch? I don't have a minute. Report! Shut off that damn noise. Shut it off. I don't recall authorising a tactical drill. What? Hey, hey, hey, hey. I don't care what colour the headrest is, or whether it can serve me iced tea. I just want a place to sit when I'm on duty. And if I hear that alarm one more time I may have you taken out and shot. Unless there's a real emergency, like a reactor breach, I don't want to be disturbed. Go away. Do I have to start locking my door? Is that right? I'm busy. Dismissed. I gave you an order. I suggest you follow it, or I'll have you confined to your quarters, until, until a Vulcan ship can come and get you. I told you not to disturb me. What are you doing? What? The one with the black hole? Turn it off. Yes. Radiation. Tell Phlox, if the the crew's sick. Tell Phlox. But not you? Bring us about. Turn the ship around. Lousy coffee. Travis. I'm in no condition to fly a starship. But you said bearing two point four. My mistake. Twelve point four. How much longer is this going to take? I'm good for that. Hold on, hold on. Zero what? Mark two-seven. Hang on a second. I feel like I'm in flight school again. I see it. We need phase cannons. Fire! Could you shut that off? Any more surprises? How's the crew? What procedure on Mister Mayweather? I did. When T'Pol and I were navigating the debris field your Tactical Alert went off. You shouldn't have. They brought the weapons online right when we needed them. If you have no objection I'd like to make it standard procedure. You still need to work on that alarm. It doesn't look any different to me. It feels better. What'd you do? What did you do? It seems totally different. That's all? I think this'll be fine, Commander. Thanks. This'll be fine. How does this sound?",91

I'll be a million kilometres away before they know I'm gone. I'm much better company. Just a few more metres. Keep your voice down. What am I supposed to call you, anyway? First Monarch? Your Highness? What is that? Some kind of a title? These lead to internal sensors. We don't have all day. We'll have to make do. Unless you know how to fly one of these things. We're crossing the subspace threshold. That wasn't so bad. To be honest, I hadn't really thought about it. I was only joking. They do have a sense of humour where you come from? It's only a matter of time before they realise we're gone. No doubt they'll come about and look for us. We need a place to hide. If I'm translating this right, there's a system about ninety million kilometres from here. We should be able to reach it in a day or so. Only one way to find out. Permission to set a course, your Sovereignty? Look, this would be a whole lot easier if you'd stop moving around. I'm afraid I don't have much choice. You're welcome to step outside until I'm done. Excuse me. There we go. Landing thrusters, No, wait, they're stabilisers. I'm working on it. Look, I've got less than twenty four hours to figure out how to scan a star system and programme a descent sequence in a language I don't understand, and I'm not going to get it done with you interrupting me every five seconds. So I'd appreciate it if you'd keep quiet until I'm finished. Now, lift your butt. Your behind, your rear end. I haven't checked that panel yet. You know, you were a lot more pleasant in stasis. I think I found the landing thrusters. I understand how difficult this must be for someone of your upbringing, but we could be stuck out here for awhile. We should find a way to get along. I'm willing to give it a try if you are. You might check that storage compartment above your head. I'm busy. If you find any water up there, I could use some. Thanks. Allow me. I'm not contagious. Depends how hungry you are. It reminds me of my first car. A four-wheeled vehicle. Wasn't much bigger than this. All we're missing is the ocean breeze coming off the Gulf. I used to drive out to a place called Chatkin Point, park along the shoreline and stare at the moon with my girlfriend. Don't worry. I won't make a pass at you. You must be a fun date. You've never been on a date? Sounds kind of lonely. There's a chain of islands near the equator. Oxygen, nitrogen, a trace of methane. Nothing we can't handle. If I could figure out how to use the bio-sensors. It's the only one with an atmosphere. Let's hope I get this right. We're entering the thermosphere. The port stabiliser's down. No, but the starboard one should keep us on course. So far so good. Eight thousand metres. I think they're metres. Seven thousand. I'm pretty sure the braking thrusters are firing. Five thousand metres. You might want to grab hold of something. Two thousand metres. One thousand. Hold on. You all right? Damned if I know. It's nothing compared to a summer in the Everglades. At least there aren't any mosquitoes. Over there. Looks like a good place to set up camp. Don't underestimate Captain Archer. It's just a scratch. I'll take care of it later. I said later. This one. It sounds like there's plenty of wildlife. I grew up in a place kind of like this. I don't think we're going to starve. And I can use the thruster assembly from the pod to start a fire, boil some water. Thanks. That's the best you could do? Keep looking. What are you waiting for? What's that supposed to mean? In case you haven't noticed, we're not in a palace. You said it yourself. You won't survive without my help, so it seems to me that I'm the one in charge. The king of the swamp. Now get your ass out there and don't come back without an armful of dry wood. You should give me a medal. You'd be dead if it weren't for me. I doubt the commoners back home would complain. You're the one who took a swing at me. I'm just a petty commoner, remember? Raised on a primitive, A homing beacon. Unless I'm way off, someone just locked on to it. No way to tell. Let's find his weapon. So, when do you ascend? It's a long shot, but maybe Enterprise will get the chance to visit Krios Prime before then. Of course, from what you've told me I doubt your family would let me see you. What kind of changes?",129

My number one priority here is the health of my first officer. If these doctors have data that can help her, I plan to get it. Actually, you did. Sub-Commander T'Pol and my doctor have explained the situation to me. Doctor Phlox assures me that he was only trying to protect her privacy. He doesn't make a habit of lying. I'm having a little difficulty understanding why you won't share your research, especially now that you know it could help T'Pol's condition. I can't believe you're withholding it to punish Doctor Phlox. Then what does it have to do with? And because you find them undesirable they're not entitled to medical care? Intimate acts? You're talking about mind-melds. If you're not going to help her the least you could do is show a little discretion. The High Command doesn't need to know about this. You have her genetic profile. You must realise she's not a member of this minority. Come in. I was just about to call you. Sit down. I'm sorry. I didn't have much luck down there. They seemed pretty pig-headed when it comes to Pa'nar syndrome, and I got the distinct feeling they're not going to keep this to themselves. Which one was he? Help? That seems like the last thing these doctors want to do. You know, it never dawned on me that it was contagious. You said it wasn't contagious, that there was nothing I could have done. That doesn't mean you shouldn't have told me. You're damn straight I do. Every last one of them. You find that strange? I guess all Vulcans find worrying strange. How useful is it? Have you figured out why Doctor Yuris gave it to you? A few minutes ago. They've decided to recall you. Doctor Oratt does. He's a ranking member of the Council of Physicians. They plan on taking you back to Vulcan when the conference is over. Not till you reach Vulcan. You've got to tell them, T'Pol. Tell them what happened. They won't do a thing to you once they know it wasn't voluntary, that he did it against your will. Why the hell not? It makes a lot of difference. You're not a member of this minority. He forced himself on you. You said it yourself. Where's Oratt? Perhaps you can't. I need to talk to you! You have no right to take my Science Officer. You can't dismiss someone just because you don't agree with the way they conduct their personal lives. Fit? You're saying a single mind-meld is enough to destroy her career? Or is it that she contracted the disease? That's why you're so hesitant to find a cure, isn't it? Why bother to help people you don't approve of? Not so fast. You know what this is, Doctor? My Communications Officer got it from the Vulcan database. It's the protocols of the Council of Physicians. It says that anyone accused of ethical misconduct is entitled to a hearing before the ranking medical officer in the province or territory where the accusation was first made. If I'm not mistaken, that would be you. Where I come from, everything's open for debate. And if I read these protocols correctly, so is the accusation you made against my Science Officer. It's mine to waste. Tomorrow afternoon. Fine. I spoke to Doctor Oratt. I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to try and talk me out of it. Not exactly. Before I left, I got the medical protocols from Hoshi. It seems they owe you a hearing. They already did. If you're not going to defend yourself, the least you can do is speak for this minority you're so eager to protect. You said you didn't want to condone the attitude of these doctors. Your silence would do just that. I'll go along with that. I promise. But you've got to understand, I'm not going to give you up without a fight. No. It has to do with how she got infected. A mind meld over a year ago. So what you're saying is that if a Vulcan, even an officer in the Science Directorate, engages in this exchange of thoughts and memories, they're condemned for it? You humans are too volatile, too irrational, too narrow-minded. That's what I heard for years, from every Vulcan I met. But we don't hold a candle to you when it comes to narrow-minded. We got rid of bigotry nearly a century ago. We're not afraid of diversity. We don't persecute it, we embrace it. If you call yourselves enlightened, you have to accept people who are different than you are. Seems my Science Officer doesn't want to discuss it. That's good enough for me. Come in. Doctor Yuris has been suspended. They offered him a hearing, but he refused. Oratt said he'll lose his standing with the Medical Exchange when they get back to Vulcan. One good thing did come out of this. They believed him when he said you were forced. You're not going to be recalled. Permission granted. I know you must be very disappointed that he broke his promise to you, but on a selfish note, I'm glad he did. I didn't want to lose you. Let's hope so.",87

We're just going to have to play it by ear. Are you sure these are the coordinates? We're not armed. I'm Captain Jonathan Archer. I'm here to see Commander Shran. I wasn't told to come alone. This is my Science Officer. She helped expose the Vulcan listening post at P'Jem. I thought Shran might enjoy seeing her again. I imagined my first diplomatic mission would involve sitting around a big table, toasting with champagne, signing things with lots of pens. They say the same thing about you. Prove them wrong. I hope I can help again, but the first thing I need is to see the hostages. The Vulcans want to know they're all right. Are you all right? You don't expect them to agree to all that. For the record, the Vulcan High Command doesn't like me very much, and, frankly, the feeling is mutual. If all you need is someone to deliver your list of demands, find somebody else. I've got other things to do. I'll see what I can do. That might be a little difficult. But not impossible. The thing is, he's going to want something in return. I'm talking about a gesture, something to show you're serious. I came down here to see about the hostages. Why don't you let them go? Release two of them, then. Keep the other one until after you've met with Soval. You're being awfully quiet. You don't seem too happy with the way I handled things down there. Thank you. You got one of your men back. They want to talk to you, not kidnap you. And if you don't, these negotiations end before they begin. Both sides are responsible for what happens here. With all due respect, Ambassador, why did you agree to let me go down there if you won't listen to my advice? You claim the Andorians are inflexible. At least they're willing to sit down and talk. The ball's in your court now. They're expecting us. We'll be fine. I plan on being back long before then. I'll try to speed things up this time. They'll send some soldiers to meet us. I'm afraid they'll want to blindfold you. It's just a security precaution. Of course. T'Pol? Archer to Enterprise. For once we're in full agreement. If you don't mind, Ambassador. I'm going to bring us in on thrusters. The ground is going to do that for us. Brace yourselves. Any idea where we are? I appreciate your help, Ambassador but we're looking for the Andorians. I gave my word to Shran. I intend to keep it. We don't know that. Sensors and communications are offline. There's weapons fire flying all over the place. We don't know what happened. This is a man who couldn't sleep because he thought he owed me something. I don't believe he asked me to come a dozen light years just so I could lead you into a trap. And right now it seems like the best thing to do is to get a cease-fire in place. The Andorians won't agree to that until they talk to you in person. I managed to keep us on course most of the way in. We can't be more than a kilometre from Shran's landing coordinates. You've been here before. I don't suppose you'd care to help? I thought Vulcans had exceptional memories. If we keep moving this way, we should be Down! They're not shooting at us. I don't recommend sticking your neck out right now. I'll take a look. Stay here. That's an order. No offence, but my ears are less likely to draw fire than yours. No. They're pulling back. Let's keep moving. Get down! Go. Over there. Hold your fire! How is he? We've brought the Vulcan ambassador to meet with Commander Shran! It looks like two of them. One on top of that structure And the other on the ground. If I can work my way around I might be able to come up from behind them. Make sure they don't see me. You don't have to hit anything, just keep them occupied. Really occupied or I'm not going to get very far. Hey. Drop your weapon. I've never fired one of these before. I'm not sure if it's set on stun. T'Pol, cease fire! You fired on my shuttle. You're trying to kill Soval, undermine everything that Shran is trying to do here. Why? Do you want a war with the Vulcans? You can take that up with him. Let's go. Are you all right? I suppose I shot the Ambassador to make my story more convincing. She's not the only one who risked their life. I said I'd bring Soval to meet you and we damn near got killed getting him here. I came because you asked me. Because you thought I could be trusted. Check Soval's wound. Check our shuttle. You'll find Andorian weapons signatures. Nice to hear your voice, Trip. T'Pol and I are fine. We're at the Andorian command post. Ambassador Soval's been injured, but Shran's medics are treating him. He's just being a good host. The Andorians are allowing the Vulcan ships to move in and pick up their people. Did you run into any problems up there? We had a pretty rough landing. We'll need a ride back to the ship. Acknowledged. Archer out. I believe someone once defined a compromise as a solution that neither side is happy with. Of course. I wouldn't go that far.",109

Tilt up about thirty degrees. Get closer. Any atmosphere? Prep a shuttlepod. Trip, meet me and Malcolm in Launch bay one. You're in charge. Keep a channel open. What's the temperature? Let's see what we can find. I doubt it's a coincidence. We may not be detecting any bio-signs, but those things sure look alive to me. Are you okay? Trip? That's what I was about to ask you. We should get him back to the ship. We're a hundred and fifty light years from Earth, Trip. He said he had some kind of out-of-body experience. You sure you're all right? I'd prefer to keep you in Sickbay for a few days, but I can't afford to. I need you to get those engines back online. Let me know if you take another trip to Tarpon Beach. I want those weapons back online, too. Come in. It's like we're in the belly of the beast. They're holding my ship hostage. We don't? Look out there. Do you see any stars? Our engines are offline, our weapons. Seems kind of hostile to me. Is there something you wanted to see me about? And? I've got to get them out of here. Go ahead. What do you mean, wrong? I'll be right down. Did he say where he was going? Archer to Commander Tucker. Find him. Commander. Hungry? It's called bread. You've never eaten it before? Where's the man who used to be Charles Tucker? I want him back now. Where is he? Where do you come from? Why did you take Commander Tucker? I want my crewman, and I want my ship released. What about Tucker? Wow what? Who told you? I thought you were with Hopalong Cassidy and your girlfriend. Take him to Sickbay. We'll let the Doctor decide how fine you are. Something smells funny. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Now that the Doctor's given Trip a clean bill of health, my primary concern is to get Enterprise out of here. But Trip tells me it'll be awhile before he can get the engines online. From what we can tell, these life forms have no mass. Non-corporeal beings. that's got to be a first for Starfleet. T'Pol thinks they just want to get to know us. Maybe she's right. Maybe I don't trust them because they're so different. I'd hate to think that was the case. Computer, pause. Come in. Everything all right? Are you sure you're all right? Go ahead. We're on our way. Enough! Humans don't like doing things without their consent. When are you planning to return Malcolm Reed? Oh, does it? Let's see how much you enjoy experiencing the human condition locked in Reed's quarters. They've got Malcolm. I need the ship Ready to go on my command. We'll see. A security detail locked him in Malcolm's quarters. Get it down, Trip. Go ahead, Trip. Hoshi, get a security team to Engineering. Have them put Crewman Rostov in his quarters. Then we're going to need more than one security team. Find out who's acting strange and have them confined to their quarters. For the moment, we're going to have to hope they are. Start working on a way to figure out who's themselves and who's not. Maybe Phlox can help you. Archer. Thanks, Trip. Hold our position. They've got Malcolm, and God knows how many others. Until we find a way to get them back, we're not going anywhere. What's the big secret? What have you got? Doctor, whatever you've got, we need to put it to work. Get to work as soon as you're ready. Go ahead. Then you'd better stay where you are. Archer to Commander Tucker. Is there some kind of shielding In the nacelles that might keep these aliens from getting in? Travis thinks it will. I need you to stop whatever you're doing and transfer all command functions To the starboard catwalk. We're going to have to get everybody in there. I want you and T'Pol to get the crew up there as quickly as you can. Hoshi. What? Security to the Bridge. You're taking over my crew. Why? We're kind of fond of our substance. We're not very anxious to give it up. Are you doing this for our benefit or for yours? Escort Ensign Sato to her quarters. How many? And outside? You okay, Travis? Trip? Thanks. What we need is to get our people back. Do you have something in mind? You wouldn't have a chance. One of those things would take you before you got back to the saucer section. What makes you think that? Even if you're right, what would you accomplish? It's too dangerous. I won't let you do it. And if you're wrong? Well, I'm not. They've already taken twenty four people.

All right. Does it have an ID tag? Good. Do you see the releases on either side? Open them. The silver ones first. Now pull the panel off. Whatever you want. Lay it down on the floor.

Now, before we can release the gas into central ventilation, you're going to have to reroute the transfer lines to the carbon dioxide tanks. Good. Now pull off the panel. It'll come off.

Trip's been taken. He left the catwalk a few minutes ago. If he tries to let his buddies out of their quarters we don't have any guards down there to stop him. You'll have to purge the osmotic filters. The valves are right behind the control circuit. You're going to have to get two fingers through the upper holes in the support plate.

Just a scratchy throat. When did you get here? Enemies of the state aren't allowed visitors. Very thoughtful of her. Are they having any luck? When this is over, whatever the outcome, I'm counting on them to get Enterprise safely out of Klingon territory. Not so bad. Can't say I'm a big fan of Klingon cuisine. Thanks for the house call, Doc. Jonathan Archer. We haven't even discussed what happened. Well, I'm not familiar with your justice system. What can I expect out there? Do I get a chance to testify? How can you do that when you haven't heard what really happened? What are they saying? I hope they're not the jury. Who's that? What about you? What's your success rate? Captain Archer of the battle cruiser Enterprise. By whose authority? I don't know your Chancellor, and I don't give a damn what he wants. I've formed an alliance with these people, and I'm going to support their revolt. Fire one shot, and you'll be joining your ancestors in the afterlife. I didn't say any of those things. Can't you object? They weren't traitors. Death to the Empire. You're not going to question him? I'd like a chance to defend myself. He's distorting the truth. Those people weren't rebels, and I wasn't trying to start a rebellion. I am not your enemy! What is this? It's a little underdone. Sorry if I interfered with your legal strategy. How? I told you, they're not rebels. I haven't been able to say anything. I've a pretty good idea. Let's say I did co-operate. What would happen to these people? And end up in a court like this one? Tell the magistrate I'm going to pass on his offer. I know them well enough. They're good people, and I won't turn them over. If you'd let me testify, tell my side of the story, it might become clear why I helped them. But from what I've seen, you're all perfectly happy to ignore what you don't want to hear. No? What's your interpretation? Better or worse? Then maybe you should remind them of those different times. Nothing like a good history lesson. Even if your client's life depends on it? I get the feeling you're as frustrated as I am. That you want to stand up to them. But you've given up. You're afraid of them. Then prove it. Challenge them. Show them what a real trial is like. I'm Captain Jonathan Archer of the Earth Starship Enterprise. We answered a distress call. They were starving. Their life support was failing. As I said, we had received a distress call. Magnify. Biosigns? Any response? Malcolm? Can you dock with them? Do your best. How long ago was that? What brought you out here? We knew that their colony had been abandoned. They were starving. They wouldn't have lasted another week. Apparently it wasn't yours, either. My Chief Engineer had determined that their vessel was beyond repair. Some of the crew will have to double up, but I think we can accommodate all of them. They were headed for a system a few light years from here. That should keep them safe from the Klingons. Looks like they didn't abandon the colonists after all. How long before they get here? Are all the refugees aboard? Cut their ship loose and go to tactical alert. I was preparing to defend my ship. They may have been subjects of the Empire, but it sure as hell looked like you had abandoned them. What's the composition of those rings? When we pulled that Klingon ship out of the gas giant, did you get a look at their sensor array? If we could ignite the plasma in those rings, would it disrupt their sensors? A few seconds will have to do. Can you modify a torpedo? How long? Get moving. We had no intention of firing first. The Bortas had dropped out of warp with their weapons charged. Hail them. I'm Jonathan Archer, captain of the Starship Enterprise. I wasn't aware they'd committed any crime. From what I can tell, they are in no condition to incite anything. Apparently their colony was abandoned by What do you intend to do with them? I'm sorry, but I'm not prepared to hand them over without a little more information. If I could speak to someone in your government. Fair enough. Let's sit down and try to Head into the rings. Put us behind it. Stand by. Fire! Let's hope theirs are, too. Get us out of here. Yes. He refused. Yes. We left the system and took the refugees with us. Because Captain Duras is not my enemy. How long should it take for a verdict? Thanks for what you've done for me. What is it? What's it the blood of? I didn't say that. How many cases have you won? There are other classes? I guess I did. For thousands of years, my people had similar problems. We fought three world wars that almost destroyed us. Whole generations were nearly wiped out. A few courageous people began to realise they could make a difference. You all right? Not all Klingons are warriors. Remember? Leave him alone. You're welcome. We have a saying on Earth. You don't kick a man when he's down. Like what? Fair? It's in our nature. New arrivals?

Flying into stars is a long way off for us. We have gone farther than any other humans. I am an explorer. Where'd you hear that? Absolutely, but I didn't think you'd be quoting it the next day. And you obviously read pretty quickly. Seems like you're picking the good ones all by yourself. That's got to be ionised hydrogen. I've got friends back at home who are not going to believe this. Close to three days. The circumference is nearly a billion kilometres. We'll be scanning surface features that are undetectable from higher altitudes. I think I'll survive. These people are fascinating, T'Pol. They have a lot to offer us. This could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship. Which reminds me. They've asked us for a sampling of films. I've put together a few suggestions. You're in charge. I'm surprised your ancestors never made it to Earth. Well, maybe now you have a reason to visit us. It's not that far. Fine with me. I wouldn't mind taking a turn at the helm. I've been watching you. I think I can handle it. A little. There's a pretty big flare forming below us. I think I can loop around it, let you get a better scan. I'll keep an eye on it. I'm starting to get the hang of this. I could take us down a little closer if you'd like. Aye, aye, Captain. Ten thousand metres it is. Absolutely. No problem. I don't see it. It's too big. We're not going to make it. It won't be enough. If you can't get over a wave, you got to dive through it. North shore of Oahu, body surfing. I think it's time you took the helm back. Archer to Enterprise. That was one hell of a ride. I'll tell you about it in a couple of hours. We've got a lot of data to download into their computers. Where is she? Where? How long ago did this happen? Will you excuse us, Sub-commander? I might have expected something like this from a first-year recruit. But not you. You did exactly what I'd do? If that's true, then I've done a pretty lousy job setting an example around here. You're a senior officer on this ship. You're privy to the moral challenges I've had to face. You know I've wrestled with the fine line between doing what I think is right and interfering with other species. So don't tell me you know what I would have done when I don't even know what I would have done! Then you didn't think hard enough. We're out here to meet new species, not tell them what to do. Giving them books is a lot different than suggesting they defy their culture. And they asked me for the books. Did she ask you to teach her how to read? And sneaking into her quarters, bringing her on Enterprise, lying about where you were going, why? Come with me. Just until we resolve this. It's not our place to tell you what rights you have. I'm sorry. I'm afraid it may not be that simple. On my world, when someone asks for asylum it has to be given serious consideration. I've been told this person is just as capable of understanding as any of you are. I've been asked to give sanctuary to someone who believes she's been treated unfairly. I can't ignore that. Given? You sound like you're talking about some inanimate object. They're not forced to do anything. You can't expect me to ignore someone when they ask for my protection. I'm afraid Shakespeare only wrote thirty six plays. So it might be best if you take your time memorising them. You sure you don't have an extra stratopod you could spare? Safe journey. Time to say goodbye to the hypergiant. Prepare to get underway, Travis. Go ahead. Put him through. Come in. I was just told that the Vissian cogenitor died. Suicide, Trip. She killed herself. You're damn right you are. And it's not just her. There's a child who won't be conceived because of this, at least not for a long while. It's time you learned to weigh the possible repercussions of your actions. You've always been impulsive. Maybe this will teach you a lesson. Do you? I'm not so sure you do. You knew you had no business interfering with those people, but you just couldn't let it alone. You thought you were doing the right thing. I might agree if this was Florida, or Singapore, but it's not, is it. We're in deep space and a person is dead. A person who'd still be alive if we hadn't made First Contact. I guess I haven't been very successful at getting through to you. If I had, you would have thought a lot harder before doing what you did. Dismissed.",73

Put us as close as you can to their EPS manifold. This was one of the researchers. Look at these biosigns. They're not human anymore. Same as the others. That's it. They've adapted. Hurry, Malcolm! Archer to Enterprise. Stand by transporter. Now. Report. There isn't anyone on that ship we can help anymore. Target their warp core. Hit them with everything we've got. Get me Admiral Forrest. Aren't you supposed to be in bed? They say doctors make the worst patients. Do you think they were trying to communicate with you? Come in. The computer analysed Phlox's numbers. They're pulsar frequencies with geometric light year measurements. They told their homeworld how to find Earth. Somewhere deep in the Delta Quadrant.

I've heard of Vulcan experiments where they were able to excite dark matter by bombarding it with metrion particles. Could you rig some kind of spatial charges? Something that would spread the metrion particles over a wider area? Get to work on these charges. This is good timing, Admiral. We just picked up some very interesting sensor readings. What are their ranges? Thanks. If this nebula exists, we don't know what effect it could have on the shuttlepod. Not this time, Trip. All the close calls he had flying warp trials, and he gets killed climbing Mount McKinley. Thanks. We? I'd prefer to handle this myself. Go ahead and meditate. I'm fine. A Starfleet Captain. A. G. Robinson. I wouldn't be out here if it weren't for him. I'm sure there's a paragraph about him in the Vulcan data base. We were in the NX test programme, trying to break the warp two barrier. There was just a few of us. Gardner, Duvall, AG and me. We all wanted the first flight Sorry I'm late, Commodore. I came straight from the test bay. Ninety two. Sir, you didn't call me here to ask about an engine test. We all know the assignment's about to be handed out. I'm guessing this is either really good news or AG's a fine pilot. Sounds good. You know I spent more time in the simulator than anyone. If I can do anything to help AG prepare for The most important thing to me is that we succeed. Is there anything else? Thanks, Ruby. Sure, why? Sherlock Holmes has nothing on you. Do you remember what Buzz Aldrin said when he stepped on the moon? Nobody does, because Armstrong went first. Congratulations. Of course not. I'm waiting for Forrest to realise what a horrible mistake he made. Until then, let me buy you a drink. To Commander A. G. Robinson. We all worked hard to get this flight, but in the end the best pilot won. Just ask him. AG. Take it easy Commander, you're due in the simulator at oh seven hundred. First flight's in two weeks. I bet you're going to tell me. And? That's right. Only one of us was going to get to fly that ship. Nothing wrong with a little healthy competition. I agree. Was that a compliment? Not exactly. He was lucky to come out of it in one piece. Maintain your orbit. We're trying to run down a problem with the stabilisation protocols. What can I get you? I'll send Ruby up to take your order. Good news AG. I just got word from the powers that be that you're good to go. Warp field initialisation in twenty seconds. We noticed that here. Do you want to bring her back to the garage? NX control to NX Alpha. You have my permission to go to warp. Warp one. One point five. That little bump you just felt was warp two. Congratulations. Now let's see if you can get it up to two point one. AG, we're getting some pretty unusual telemetry down here. We need you to go sublight until we get this sorted out. Did you hear me? Negative. Abort! Warp two point one five. Two point two. AG, you've got to get out of there. NX Control to NX Alpha, come in. AG, can you hear me? We should be entering the nebula. As Doctor Phlox would say, optimism. Time to put Trip's charges to the test. Three seconds. Anything? We need to move deeper into the nebula, if it exists. The field emissions on the charges could have been too low, or maybe we're just on a wild goose chase. He made the record books for being the first person to deploy an escape pod at warp, but he lost one of two NX prototypes. Nearly derailed the entire programme. Are you all right? You where ordered to abort. He's right. This is a new engine. It's bound to have a few bugs to work out. We've got a lot of data to analyse before we know what happened. We should be grateful we only lost the ship. Who's Cyrus? What's your name, Lieutenant? Trip? Thanks with your help today with our Vulcan friends, Trip. My father would have appreciated it.

With all due respect, sir, we should approach with caution. The freighter captain was of questionable character. Sir? A storage bay, sir. Conduit housings, I believe. Because of our mission, sir. Right. Right. Understood. We should have worn EV suits. Safe? You call this safe? I've been in Yes, sir. Their linings are coated with a platinum-cobalt alloy. Trip could probably strip them down and separate the metals. Something doesn't smell right. The ionised particles will cover our descent. It'll be all right. Have you heard from the Captain? The ships? They're armed to the teeth down there, but it is do-able. We only have one bone of contention. The Major here thinks my security team is far to valuable to bring down and put in the line of fire. He wants to take his men. I plan to have my men back on board with the Captain and Trip long before those ships arrive. Select six of your men and meet me in launch bay one. I'll be commanding the mission. Coming from a military family, I've seen men like Hayes all my life. That had nothing to do with who knows Enterprise inside and out. It had to do with who the Major thinks is more capable of carrying out this rescue. The lower levels are hyper-saturated with ionised particles, so you'll have to get within a hundred metres to pick up their biosigns. Captain! It took a little doing, sir, but we got through the outer hatch. Reed to Mayweather. We've got them. Lock onto my location and set down. We cleared bioscan, that's all that matters. The Doctor's got them back in their quarters already. I'm not so sure about that. See you in the morning. No, sir. No vessels, no signs of technology, nothing.

Your ship attacked a Xindi vessel. I want to know everything you can tell me about them. You heard me. You're lying. Your manifest said you took their ship less than two weeks ago. Tell me what you know. Where are they now? You destroyed them? Where did they come from? Which species of Xindi were they? What did they look like? Are you sure? We'll see about that. As you were. Ensign. Shut up. Get in. The Xindi. This airlock has a decompression rate of point five atmospheres per minute. You'd better start talking now, because in about forty seconds you won't be able to. The Xindi. Everything's under control, Lieutenant. Not for another twenty seconds he won't. The Xindi. Your memory getting any better? Say again? Take him back to the Brig. Eventually. When they attacked the Xindi ship they took more than fuel and supplies. They downloaded their database. How close would we have to get to tap into their main computer? He gave them to me. Here. I want that database. Go to Tactical Alert. Tell Trip we're going to need all the power he can spare for weapons and hull plating. We're going to wait for them to find us, Travis. Move us into position. Stand by. Have they detected us? Open a channel. This is Captain Archer. Remember us? You probably noticed that our weapons are back online. You're outgunned, so stand down. One kilometre, Travis. Get ready. Stay with them. Hoshi? Travis! How long do you need? Emergency bulkheads. Head back to the sphere. Where are they? How much did you get? Take us closer to that portal. Let's see if we can lure them back in here. Use our forward phase cannon. Fire a single burst, minimum yield. Travis? Again. Stay within a kilometre. Return fire. Can you take out their engines? Ensign. Good enough. Mister Reed. Keep our weapons locked on them. Your codes worked. Get him out of there. Escort him to the Launch bay. We're taking you back to the sphere. Computer, load the Xindi database.",141

I picked up a crate when we were back on Earth. Chef's been keeping then in stasis for me. They're as fresh as the day they were picked. Aren't you going to try one? Come on. One bite? Maybe you haven't noticed, but I've been a little busy lately. It's not like I didn't want to come back. After our last session I slept like a baby. First time in months. So, should I just Shoes? Hold on. You never said anything about feet. Well, for one thing, I haven't had a shower since this morning, and I know how sensitive that Vulcan nose of your can be. And I'm a little ticklish. Maybe more than a little. Oh! Your hands are ice cold. You sure this is safe? I mean, has anyone ever tried it on a human before? That's the spot. But these aren't human. Then where's the rest of our team? The only reason I don't have a search party down there right now is because you needed more time to analyse the data. Now unless you can give me a damn good reason to wait around You're saying these alien biosigns could be our people. Prep shuttlepod two. We'll use EV suits and biohazard protocols. Have the Decon chamber ready when we get back. They're about three kilometres east of us. We don't have too many options for a landing site. Hope you boys are up for a little walk. Keep your weapons on stun. Circle around. Chang! What about you? Sub-Commander! He didn't even recognise me. Any idea what caused this? Why did it have so little effect on T'Pol? I'm doing my best. Go ahead. Open a channel. Sorry, it wasn't very well marked. We're aware of that. Is there anything you can tell us about No one's coming aboard unless I say so. That infected organism is a member of my crew. There isn't any outbreak. Lieutenant Reed is in medical isolation. Look, we've only been dealing with this virus for one day, so forgive me if I don't take your word for it that the only option is to neutralise our Tactical Officer. You want to come over to discuss the situation, fine, but if you try to force your way onto this ship you're going to have one hell of a fight on your hands. Destroyed? Where did it come from? Why's he so eager to get back to a place called Urquat? I'd prefer to have Doctor Phlox examine them. We can't launch a shuttlepod, they'd detect it. Do you think T'Pol's contagious? That rules out the transporter. She'd infect the entire crew. Be right back. Go ahead. Keep an eye on them. You all right? Believe me, I wish I'd had a choice. There are more of them in orbit. We'd better get back to the shuttlepod before they realise anything's wrong. We're docking, Travis. Tell Phlox to stand by in Decon. Go to warp four as soon as we're in. Report. Try to stay ahead of them. Stand by weapons. Don't respond. Hold your course. Full power to aft hull plating. Look, we both want the same thing. A cure for this virus, right? Our doctor thinks he's found one, but he needs a little more time Like I said, he just needed a little more time.

A V'radian chemist we met at the deuterium station claims he knows a way to synthesis it. We're working on it, Doctor. Just dreams. I keep seeing myself back at that alien city. The chemist said his shop was on barge twelve. I'm afraid we'll have to save the souvenir hunting for another time. Thank you. We're looking for barge twelve, a chemist named B'Rat Ud. That's not necessary. No, thank you. Can you direct us to the chemist? I have an appointment. We met at the deuterium station on Norellus. You said you could sell us the formula to synthesise trellium-D. I hope you didn't bring us all this way for nothing. A little pressed for time. We're on a diplomatic mission. Who? Commander Tucker has the list of supplies and equipment we'd be willing to barter. As a gesture of good faith, why don't you tell me where we can find this merchant, then you and Mister Tucker can work out the details. B'Rat Ud said you might be able to help us. We were told you've recently done business with some Xindi. We're not interested. I want to know where we can find these Xindi. Where were they heading? Archer. Understood. We'll meet you back at the shuttlepod. Thanks for your time. I don't think so. Looks like she doesn't want to go with you. Let's get out of here! How's our guest? I'm afraid I don't even know your name. Let's get something straight. We don't believe one person can own another person. You're free to go wherever you'd like. How far is your home world? Do you have any family? We have some data on this region of space. I'll see if I can locate Oran'taku. If it's possible, we'll take you there. Set her up in quarters, get her whatever she needs. How are your accommodations? There are some restricted areas on Enterprise, otherwise feel free to look around. I seriously doubt it. Nearly all. You've met Doctor Phlox, he's from Denobula. My first officer's a Vulcan. We're trying to make contact with a species called Xindi. I don't suppose you know anything about them? We're hoping to resolve a disagreement. Archer. I'll be right there. Excuse me. How unstable? And we're supposed to insulate the entire ship with it? Get started. Come in. Is everything all right? Er, I'm not quite, er. Please. I meant to speak with you earlier. We have some good news. T'Pol was able to locate your home planet in a database we acquired. It's only two days away. You don't seem very pleased. You never know. You seem very memorable to me. That isn't necessary. Rajiin, you That really isn't something that I No. We'll be leaving orbit soon. Good night. Leaving so soon? We jammed your signal. Your friends can't hear you. Who are they? Take her to the Brig. I want to talk to her. How long? Have Phlox take a look at your head. Who were you trying to contact? I asked you a question. What did you do to T'Pol? Who are you? That's right. Kidnapped when you were a child, sold into a life of slavery, and it was just a coincidence that you happened to escape when I was at that market. The chemist knew I was looking for information about the Xindi. Is that why you showed up so conveniently? Care to be a little more specific? Who, the Xindi? How do you know I won't do the same? Tell me who you contacted. Who! Go ahead. Hull plating to full power, stand by weapons. The Reptilian species. They're the ones who sent you. I assume they're here for you. Forgive me if I don't take your word on that, but they murdered seven million people on my planet! Go ahead. Seal that airlock and post security teams. I'm on my way. What was your mission? About what? We know that. Go on. Where are they building the weapon? When will it be ready? Get a security detail down here. No one's taking her anywhere. They're heading for the Brig. Try to cut them off. You're with me. Archer to the Bridge. Don't let those ships get away. Lay in a pursuit course. I want a complete autopsy, Doctor, and have Malcolm take this weapon apart. I want to find out it's range, power output and how we can defend against it. Are you okay? Good, because I want an analysis of the scans we took of those Xindi ships, and find out what you can about that vortex they went through. I don't want them dropping in unannounced again.

Good isotope density. We should get at least half a kilo out of this one. Let's try for something bigger this time. How about this one. Travis? Shut it down. This thing's useless. The coils are fused. They're pretty unpredictable. You sure you could land safely? This'll be a new one for the maintenance crew. This one's more isolated, and I'm reading large deposits near the surface. Can you set us down? You're the pilot, it's your call. Looking good. Two hundred metres. You're drifting to the left. Are you kidding? I'm going to recommend they give you a medal. Let's try to make this quick. It was minor. Nothing to write home about. Don't worry. It only tends to blow up in its liquid state. Go ahead. We saw it. Don't worry about me. Just get us the hell out of here. There's debris in the intake manifold. Can you purge it? Can you get us home? Shuttlepod two to Enterprise. We're on our way back, but we've taken damage. Alert the launch bay crew to get ready for a rough docking. Looks like the impulse assembly took a beating. Open up the engine housings and run a diagnostic. Tucker here. Route it down here. Pod two took some damage in the asteroid field, sir. We're looking at a couple of hours before we can launch again. What's the problem? Acknowledged. Anything else? Aye sir. You heard the Captain. Get a repair team down here. It doesn't make sense. T'Pol and I have been working with trellium for weeks. She hasn't shown any symptoms. Are you all right, Captain? Stand by. You're clear, sir. We're fine, sir. See you back on Enterprise. We got over Aye, sir. No, he died in a house fire. What about the gardener? He was there too. Part of the fun of a mystery is trying to solve it before it ends, using logic. You of all people should appreciate that.",48

The simulation suggests that the anomalies occur where the waves intersect. If we're going to create an accurate map, we'll need precise measurements of the sphere's gravimetric fields. Less than four light years. Yes, Captain. You assume correctly. Yes, sir. We're getting reports of anomalies on all decks. Breaches on decks B, C and E. Emergency bulkheads are in place but three subsections have decompressed. If there is another sphere in the region, it's emitting a lot more gravimetric energy than the first one. Approximately seventy five thousand kilometres. Indeed. Go ahead. Adjust your heading to oh one six mark two. I believe you just grazed the perimeter. Turn starboard three point six degrees. Maintain course. You should be heading directly towards the cloaking barrier. We're here, Captain. Everything's going offline. Main and auxiliary power, warp engines, life support. Power's returning to all systems. The data you collected allowed me to create a nearly accurate map of the anomalies. These are the coordinates where we've encountered strong anomalies. Exactly. The locations are being influenced by more than two gravimetric sources. A third sphere would correct some of the error but not all of it, so I had the computer run a covariant extrapolation.

So far, they haven't responded to any traditional therapies, but I'm synthesising an antigen that shows some promise. You can be assured I won't stop working on this until I find a cure. We've lost thirteen of the crew, twenty two injured, several critical. Nothing seems to have changed since your last exam. You didn't tell him? After this settlement was established, it became clear that I was never going to find a treatment for your condition if I remained here, so I returned home and consulted with some of the finest neurosurgeons and quantum theorists on Denobula. My colleagues believed there was no way to destroy these parasites short of vaporising you in a subspace implosion. They assured me the technology to do what was required did not exist, and they were correct. It took almost a decade to develop, but now I'm ready to put it to the test. The procedure requires tremendous amounts of energy, levels that can only be produced in the reactor of a warp powered starship. A visit to Engineering may be in order first. I'll be using a highly focused antiproton beam to eradicate the parasites. We'll start with this cluster today. This procedure's never been attempted before. We should move cautiously. The emitters should be calibrated within the hour. Phlox to Captain Archer. We're ready. Increase to eight hundred millicochranes. Increase to eight fifty. Just as my simulations predicted. There's no trace of the parasites I targeted. Well, I understand I may have a passenger on my voyage home. Have you told the Captain how you feel about him? It's obvious you've become quite attached. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Vulcan's experience the same emotions as any other species. They're simply better at hiding them. I can only imagine what it must have been like. Spending all those years in that house, learning so much about him, yet he remembers nothing about you beyond the day he became ill. If we're successful, perhaps things will be different. What is it? Your engineers won't let us continue with the Captain's treatment. This maybe the only solution to your problems, Captain. This image was taken a few minutes ago. You can see the region where I eradicated the first cluster of parasites. It's gone in this image, as well. This scan was taken over twelve years ago. The cluster has disappeared from all the scans I've taken over the last twelve years. It's as if it never existed at all We know they're from another spatial domain. Apparently, they also exist outside of time. If we can eliminate all of the parasites, it's possible the Captain's infection will never have occurred. We only have to divert power for a few hours. I am certain I can complete the procedure in that time. Go ahead. Understood. I'm sorry, Captain. The chamber's been damaged. You'll destroy the ship? How do you feel? You suffered a mild concussion. I'd like to keep you overnight for observation.",33

Doctor Phlox says we have to prepare for the possibility that Trip won't survive. How is he? How does this relate to Trip? It becomes a clone. And you want to do this with Trip. Use his DNA to grow a simbiot. It's fifteen day life span. Come in. But the longer we remain in the field, the more these particles build up. Do whatever you have to do, but we need to get those engines back online. I approved it. We don't answer to the Lyssarrian Prime Conclave. I'm aware of the ethical implications. If we weren't in the Expanse maybe my decision would be different, but we've got to complete this mission. Earth needs Enterprise, Enterprise needs Trip. It's as simple as that. Three days ago he was just another one of your creatures, something you kept on a shelf. Sounds like you've found yourself a new roommate. I'm sure you'll think of something. So the older he grows, the more of Trip's life he'll recall? He's starting to look like Trip. It's only been three days and he's already beginning to realise how different he is. I gave the order that created him. I should be the one to explain why. Whoa! Where do you think you're off to? Now, don't take it personally. Fetching isn't his style. It's almost time for his dinner. Do you want to help me feed him? Come on. There's nothing Porthos likes more than dinnertime. I haven't taught him any. Mostly what he does is eat, sleep, and not fetch. Just fill it up half way. Is that right. That's right, he did. That's a picture of him right there, and this is me on my first day of flight school. As long as I can remember. It's what I was meant to do. It has its moments. Let me show you something. Keep the nose up. That's right. Trim the port aileron. What? That's a little difficult to answer. Nothing a little glue won't remedy. I crashed it plenty of times myself. Come with me. It's okay. That's right. Yes. No. You're more than that, Sim. You have Trip's memories, but you also have your own memories, the ones you're making here on Enterprise. You were born only four days ago. It's hard to understand, I know. There's part of you, something inside you, that Trip needs. Doctor Phlox is going to have to perform an operation. When Phlox says it, it's the truth. Sure. Archer to T'Pol. Would you please come to my Ready room. I'm afraid that won't be soon enough. According to Malcolm, the accumulation on the hull is generating a diamagnetic field. It's having a dampening effect. The more the particulate builds up, the more powerful the field becomes. In another four days every system on the ship will be offline. If we don't make it out of here by then, we never will. Come in. That's out of the question. This is a dangerous procedure. You've never flown a shuttlepod before. I can't jeopardise this ship on the strength of those memories. Mayweather and Reed will pilot the shuttlepods. I want you to co-ordinate from the Bridge. T'Pol will assist you. Yeah, that's part of it. My main concern is that this plan work. If we don't make it out of here in the next six hours it won't matter if Trip survives or not. We'll all be dead. Try the doors. Archer to shuttlepods one and two. Whenever you're ready. Come on. Come on. Go ahead. Sim. Sorry, Sim. Archer to the shuttlepods. How much do we need? That's good enough. Archer to shuttlepods one and two. Come on home. Well done. You wanted to see me? I'm listening. You told me you could remove the tissue without harming him. That isn't how we see it. Is there any truth to it? Doctor? How long have you been staying here? These are Trip's quarters. Commander Tucker is lying in Sickbay. If you refuse to go through with this you'll be condemning Trip to death. No, but you can save him. Phlox says there's almost no chance that the enzyme will work. But at what cost? It'll take a day to synthesise the enzyme. By that time your neural tissue won't be compatible with Trip's anymore. He'll die. I can't let that happen. If you truly have all of Trip's memories, you know the answer to that. I don't have to tell you what's at stake. I must complete this mission, and to do that I need Trip. Trip! I'll take whatever step's necessary to save him. Even if it means killing you. Don't make me one. What's the problem? Archer to the Launch Bay. Come in. What stopped you? What would that be? I can't argue with you there. What? I believe that. That's why I gave the order to create you. Thanks. We will never forget what he did for us, and for the ship he loved so much. We will go forward with renewed determination to complete this mission, so that his sacrifice won't just have been for the people on this ship, but for all the citizens of Earth.",107

But you are now. Set a course. Tell Trip I want everything he can give me from the engines. And? How long to go around it? Alert the crew. It's going to get rough. Go ahead. Acknowledged. T'Pol? Do your best. Travis, take us in. One half impulse. Just how accurate is this map of yours? Expanding? Emergency power to hull plating. Brace for impact. Come about. Get us out of here. Can you identify it? I guess we owe someone a thank-you. You don't seem to be having any trouble. That explains how you got here. It doesn't explain why. Why are you here? Phase cannons? How long to fix them? Commander Shran offered to send his Tactical Officer over to help. The kemocite signal Hoshi picked up could lead us to the Xindi weapon. We're going to need our defences. I don't like the idea of having the Andorians down here any more than you do, but we could use their help. Good. Let's put them to work. You been talking to Lieutenant Reed? They're here to help, T'Pol. I'm not going to ask them to work with guns at their heads just because you don't like them. I appreciate that, but whatever problems exist between Vulcan and Andoria don't involve us. What happened? Is that your assessment or the High Commands? I don't trust them either, T'Pol, but based on my experience I think I can trust Commander Shran. I appreciate the gesture, but we have a lot of repairs to make. Thanks. So, how did you get picked for this assignment? We keep doing each other favours. Close enough, Travis. We don't want to give ourselves away. Any biosigns? I don't think they attacked anyone. It's Bikini Atoll. When my species was developing primitive nuclear weapons they needed places to test them. One was a remote island called Bikini Atoll. It's possible. If they are getting ready to test their weapon, we're running out of time. I agree. We need to get a closer look. What's the status of our repairs? Weapons? How long? If they are here to test that thing, we may not have two days. I don't intend to destroy it. If we could get our hands on this weapon, Starfleet might be able to figure out a defence. We're going to take it. Report. Can we get a closer look? Gralik. An arboreal Xindi that we met at a facility that manufactured one of the components for the weapon. He promised to help us. Looks like he kept his word. How long until it's safe enough to get close? We've got to get to it before they do. What if we shield the launch bay, evacuate all the adjacent compartments. Could we bring it aboard any sooner? That's a generous offer, but what are we supposed to do, cheer you on? Archer to Lieutenant Reed. What's the status on weapons? We're going to need them. Archer out. I appreciate your offer, Shran. We accept. I'm going with you. I plan to be there when you bring the weapon aboard. That's not good enough. If something goes wrong. What happened to this being a joint venture? They're going to have to. This is my mission. This isn't about pride. The Xindi killed seven million humans, not Andorians. I won't put the fate of my people in the hands of the Imperial Guard. Now, we could use your help, but if you're not happy with me calling the shots then we'll go it alone. Try to keep them busy.

Now I see why you generously offered to let us use your ship, you son of a bitch. I'm starting to think the Vulcans may be right about you. What are you talking about? You're putting Earth at risk because of a border dispute with the Vulcans? I guess I'm not familiar with the Andorian concept of help. My crew won't let you take the weapon without a fight. You'll have to slow down to pass back through the anomaly field. You like to talk about repaying debts. I've owed you that for a long time. What about our sensors? Their ship? You don't think I'd let your people work on my ship without appropriate supervision. Give us the weapon. No, I think you're going to give it to us. Willingly. You tossed me overboard before I had a chance to thank you for letting us access your sensor telemetry. When the Xindi tested the weapon we were able to intercept their activation codes. Give it to us, or we'll detonate it in your cargo bay. I'd rather do that than let you take it back to Andoria. I can't take the chance that you'd use it against the Vulcans. You said you came to help us, Shran. You can still make good on your offer. You're not giving me any choice. T'Pol. I'd get rid of it while you still can. Shran. Let's get moving. The Andorians?

I doubt they'll look for us there. It's been a while since you referred to those overgrown grasshoppers as your own people. Probably because of the bloodworms. They're used during interrogations. Their secretions act as a truth serum, makes the prisoners more co-operative. But there's a side effect. Sometimes they can suppress memories. The same thing happened when they questioned me. I forgot everything that happened since flight school. It'll start to come back to you. Give it a few days. Three years. They wanted information about the weapon. This is going to take some time. What's the last thing you remember? The weapons test. It failed because your prototype was sabotaged. Because I'm responsible for it. Your kemocite shipment was tampered with. He wasn't too happy when I told him what you were planning to do with his kemocite. He was. In the end it didn't make much of a difference. We didn't stop your programme, we only slowed it down. A few weeks later the weapon was launched. It destroyed my planet. I don't know if you'd call it a success. After Earth was destroyed the old Xindi rivalries surfaced again. The insectoids started attacking other Xindi colonies. They killed thousands of your people. There wasn't a lot they could do. While you were busy constructing the weapon, the insectoids were secretly building hundreds of new ships. They used Earth as a diversion. Their real goal was to dominate the other Xindi species. Are you all right? It's just a bloodworm. It'll work its was out. Hold still. I think you need this more than I do. Suit yourself. Trust me, it didn't happen overnight. You gave me this the first day we were locked up together. The guards thought it would be entertaining to put us in the same cell. They even placed wagers on who would survive the longest. I was in pretty bad shape at the time so you were the odds-on favourite. Your people killed everyone I ever cared about. I was going to make sure you never walked out of that cell. For weeks we tried to kill each other. I was lying in the infirmary when I finally asked myself, what was the point. My world was gone, but so was yours. So I made a proposal. The two of us would work together to get out of that place. Took us longer than either one of us thought, but here we are. It's a Malosian cargo shuttle. They're traders. They bring supplies to the prison a few times a month. No weapons, but she's sturdy enough to get us where we're going. Not exactly. When we were getting close to finding your weapon the insectoids sent their ships after us. They boarded Enterprise and took me prisoner, then they planted spatial charges around our warp reactor. My crew was still aboard when they detonated them. The Council? You told me you'd heard from Naara before you were sent to prison. She and the children were safe. We have a ship now. We can look for them. There's nothing in range. Do you remember the coordinates? There may have been survivors. Reactor coolant. The conduit must have ruptured in the attack. Take it. You're the one with a family. You want to see them again? Try to seal the rupture. I'll see if I can close off the coolant tanks. T'Pol. Keep an eye on him. Trip. What have we got? Can we scan them for a weapons facility? Degra's a senior official. We know he's designing the weapon. There's a chance he'd keep his family close by. What do you mean? It's too risky. If he suspects something, we'll wind up right back where we started. He'll tell me. I just need a little more time. Why didn't we see it before? Have they seen us yet? See what you can do about their engines. Hail them. Stand down and prepare to be boarded. Anything? What about navigational logs? Does it mention the weapon? Let me know what else you find. Not your typical nacelle configuration? Learn everything you can. I want to know where you're building the weapon. The hell you don't. Your name is Degra. I was at the Xindi colony when you picked up your shipment of kemocite. Your people are planning another attack. I'm not going to let that happen. Where's the weapon? Archer to the Bridge. Report. What's causing it? All right. Take the ship out of the field but keep us close by. If you won't tell me what I need to know, perhaps one of your men will. But this is a Xindi reptilian. Would it work on a primate? How selective could this memory wipe be? Hoshi can help with that. Let's get started. T'Pol, I could use your help with some of the details. If he buys into this, Degra's going to want to know everything that's happened in the last three years. I can't make up the whole story on the spot. Nice work. I'm not sure about the grey. This is only supposed to be three years from now. You're sure these are safe? I'll do my best. Spatial anomalies. We're passing through a field of them. Hold on. Obviously not. We're losing structural integrity. I'm taking us out of warp. We'll never make it through this field in one piece. We don't have enough fuel. We should send a distress call. One of your ships might be close enough to hear it. We don't have a lot of choices. What's the frequency? One of the inmates told me all about Maarek Three. He used it as a staging area when he was smuggling dilithium. Beautiful, with beaches that go on for thousands of kilometres. First thing I'm going to do is find a cold lake and take the longest bath of my life. It sounded a lot like Earth, the way he described it. This colony of yours, you never told me about it. Why'd you live there? It's been a long time since anyone called me Captain. It's Jonathan, remember? I never really had an opportunity to start one. I was away from home a lot. Actually, you haven't. We're being hailed. Whoever it is, they must be pretty far away. I'll try to clear it up. Better make it fast. At least you know they're all right. We should still change course. Do you know the coordinates? What's wrong? Be my guest. You encrypted the navigation controls. Do you mind if I ask how long it will take to get there? What will your people think when you show up with me. Humans probably aren't their favourite species. I appreciate that. I'm not sure. Subspace turbulence. You still don't believe me, do you. It's been years since you've said anything. This isn't necessary. Piral and Jaina. Take him to the Brig. When did you realise. We know your ship has been there, recently. You gave us the coordinates of a red giant. I guess I'll just have to wipe your memory clean again, go back into the simulator and start this whole thing over. I think you didn't figure it out until after the malfunction. I'd be willing to bet those co-ordinates are real. We can't afford to lose three weeks if the weapon isn't there. Have you learned anything more about how they open the subspace vortices? I want to see all the data you've collected. Archer to the Bridge. We're ready. Emergency bulkheads! You're the engineer? You're going to help us. We adapted your technology, used our main deflector to open a subspace vortex. If you don't do what he says, this ship will break apart. Lieutenant. Tell him to do what he's told. Trip. Go ahead. Take him back to the Brig. Report. What's our status? Arm all weapons. Lay in a course for those kemocite signatures, full impulse. Get him out of here. Show him. Thanks for your help. Take him to Sickbay. I think you overdid the turbulence just a little, Ensign. How's it coming? As long as they don't know we were here, we can leave them with a mystery. Go ahead.",128

He wants to put your security team and all the senior officers through a series of training drills. These would be different. They'd be conducted by Major Hayes and the MACOs. We're heading into a hostile situation. We don't know what we're going to face when we get there. The MACOs' tactics and technology are two, three years beyond Starfleet's. Why not let them pass on some of that expertise? You don't agree. Hayes and his men have gone up against a few aliens on this mission, including the Xindi. They've handled themselves pretty well. I'd like you to co-ordinate the training sessions with the Major. What's the problem. What do you mean? Maybe it's one of the navigational sensors. Let's go take a look. Let's see it. Are there any other ships in the vicinity? Bring the grappler online. Try again. Travis. Archer to Engineering. The helm's not responding. We need full reverse Right away. Get us out of here. Do you think you can stop it? I'm Captain Archer. Your vessel has minimal life support. You wouldn't last too long if we took you back. What was that pod designed to do? You're dying. We're doing everything we can for you, but How's it coming? Get us underway as soon as you can. Learn anything? Do you think the Spheres have something to do with creating this thing? Maybe the alien we picked up is the last survivor. I want you and Trip to take a look at the pod. If we can't revive the alien, it may be our best source of information. You remember the Triannon creation myth? And that the Spheres were reshaping the Expanse into a paradise for the faithful. A canary. On Earth, miners used to take canaries into the tunnels with them. If the canary didn't die, the miners knew the air would be safe to breathe, and they could proceed. I want to talk to him again. Find a way. Until I get the answers I need, we're going to have to bend a few ethics. Notify me when he's conscious. We know you were sent here as some kind of test subject. The region of space where we found you. What is it? Hold off a second. Keep going. I find that hard to believe. We found you drifting in a pod, hooked up to banks of monitoring equipment. You're telling me you have no idea why? That's impossible. Tactical alert. Senior officers to their posts. He's on B deck. Malcolm, status. Archer to Engineering. Doctor Phlox says you have a detached retina, a bruised left kidney. We're in a dangerous region of space. We're trying to stop an alien race from destroying Earth. We face attacks from all sides, enemies everywhere we go. The last thing I need is to hear that two of my senior officers have been admitted to Sickbay because they suddenly regressed to the level of five year olds. Don't try to tell me who started it! I don't know what the problem is between you two, and to tell you the truth I don't care, but I want it settled right now. Settle it! That's an order! How are the drills going? Archer. On my way.

Heel, that's it. Heel. Porthos. All right, but just for a moment. That's enough. You can come and see him again tomorrow. It says here that canines can be quite territorial. Is that why you keep returning to the Captain's quarters? On Earth, a dog called Scruffers travelled three thousand kilometres attempting to reunite with it's human keeper. I heard of a Pycan space moth that drifted half a light year trying to return to it's home world, but I don't believe it had a name. I could use a walk. How about you? Dear Doctor Lucas. I apologise in responding to your last letter. As you can imagine, the crew and I have been quite busy. In we go. I was deeply saddened to hear about your colleagues lost in the Xindi attack. You have my condolences. It's unfortunate you were forced to cut your time on Denobula short, but obviously you're needed on Earth. Perhaps when our mission is successfully completed I'll see you back in San Francisco. The Expanse. An extremely curious place. For example, we've recently encountered a phenomenon that, er. Do you want one of these? I doubt you'd like it. It's a leech, you know. It will clean out your intestinal tract. Don't tell the Captain. I apparently find myself in somewhat unsettling circumstances, Doctor Lucas. Although they have allowed me the luxury of catching up on my correspondence. We first encountered the phenomenon responsible for this situation two days ago. That's true, unless we take the appropriate precautions. The reconfigured space disrupts the human neocortex, but I can counteract the effects by dampening the crew's neurological activity. It would be like, oh, shutting down the main computer to protect it from an ion storm. Quite simply, I can place each of you in a comatose state until we've passed through the affected region. Shouldn't cause any problems. Commander Tucker was none too keen on my plan. However, I was able to convince Captain Archer. Since my Denobulan physiology is immune to the effects of the disturbance, I volunteered to watch over the crew. So far, they've been no trouble at all. While the computer's controlling most of the ship's systems, I was given a quick tutorial, just in case. Despite the dire circumstances I must say I relished the challenge and soon developed a new-found respect for Ensign Mayweather. Every two hours. I imagine it would. These are hardly normal circumstances. I can't do that. Even a few minutes of exposure would cause permanent damage. Sleeping peacefully, except for you. Now, lie back. Please, Captain, I've told you the procedure's completely safe. Captain, I have already had this discussion with Commander Tucker, Lieutenant Reed and virtually every other officer on the ship. I'm not comfortable being incapacitated, I really should be at my post, I'm willing to risk staying awake. Well you can't, nor do you need to. I assure you I have everything well in hand. Well, thank you, Captain. I must say, Doctor Lucas, that I appreciated the Captain's vote of confidence. I had in fact been feeling some trepidation over the responsibility I'd been handed, but after two days at the helm the ship is running perfectly. Hello? Hello? Nonetheless, I'm not ashamed to admit I'll be relieved when I can wake up the crew in two days, sixteen hours and forty three minutes. I know, I know, I'm sorry I'm late. Did you hear that? Computer, mute sound. That doesn't sound normal, does it. I suppose we should investigate, hmm. I'm not going alone. Come, Porthos, come. I'd be better off talking to my Pyrithian bat. Perhaps we are letting our imaginations run away with us. I should never have let Mister Tucker talk me into watching The Exorcist last week. Hello? It's Doctor Phlox. Porthos! Porthos, come back here. Porthos. Well, now don't you feel foolish. I called out. Didn't you hear me? You could hear that all the way from the mess hall. Bangs, squeaks, rattling chains. Is this a starship or a haunted house? Considering you nearly sent me into cardiac shock. I have had a slight headache since we entered this region. Perhaps Vulcans and Earth canines are better able to adapt to it than Denobulans. How are you? I've barely seen you the last two days. Then you're due for a night out. Why don't you join Porthos and me? The movie's quite amusing. T'Pol, I, er, perhaps you'll share a meal with me later. Hello? T'Pol? Is that you? Stop! Phlox to T'Pol. Would you mind not creeping around the ship like a Draxxan cloud viper. Please. I wouldn't have imagined that Vulcans engaged in childish games. What were you doing in Engineering just now? I hope you don't mind eating here in the galley. Mess hall seems a bit, er, oh, melancholy. All the empty chairs. My fifth grandmother made this for each of my weddings. Chef's tried to prepare it, but he never gets it quite right. I always thought so, but was afraid to mention it. T'Pol, you're sure you weren't in Engineering today? We're supposed to be assisting each other. It's a large ship for two people to maintain. I could have sworn there was someone in that room with me. No, everyone except us is in deep neuro-sedation. Obviously. You've never been to Denobula, have you. The cities are quite crowded, by choice, not by necessity. The atmosphere is vibrant, communal. What I'm saying is that we're a sociable people. Being alone on Enterprise, just the two of us, has proven more stressful than I imagined. Two people aren't even enough for a Denobulan marriage, a proper one anyway. That isn't what I meant. Such as Commander Tucker. I understand, but I for one will never complain again when I can't get a good seat on movie night. Despite the tragic circumstances surrounding your homecoming, Doctor Lucas, you must be happy to return to Earth. As I've mentioned before, I've no regrets about accepting my position on Enterprise. However, it has struck me recently how much I miss the familiar pleasures of my home. You've experienced the nightclubs in our Kaybin district, so you know the excitement of meeting a new companion or two. The intimacy that can develop so quickly when all parties are receptive. You humans are a truly remarkable species, Doctor Lucas, but when Enterprise has accomplished its mission I look forward to being among Denobulans again. The more of them, the better. Good afternoon, Captain. How are we feeling today? Neurochemistry looks excellent, theta waves are good, you should wake up extremely well rested. Phlox to T'Pol. I told you, it was outside of the ship, on the hull. What about alien vessels? You said this reconfigured space could be affecting our systems. What if it's interfering with our sensors? I didn't imagine it! I saw something. What about what I saw in Engineering? I need to finish my rounds. Get away from her! Phlox to T'Pol. It's the Xindi. They're on board. We'll need to arm ourselves. I saw two. There could be more of them. Then the sensors must be wrong. They were real. I saw them. They could have transporter technology. What difference does it make how they got on board. If we wake up Lieutenant Reed or the MACOs they will be incapacitated in minutes, dead within hours. It is up to us to deal with this situation. I plan to start on G deck and work my way up. I'm going to stop them whether you help me or not. That leaves three to go. They could be trying to destroy Enterprise. What better time than while the crew is incapacitated. A biosign. This isn't human. I can't lock onto it. You said it wasn't affecting our sensors. I have it. It's just ahead. It's all right. Fortunately I'm not very proficient with hand weapons. I, er, I believe I. We went for a walk earlier. I might have neglected to put him back in my quarters. I've been distracted. I would have thought this could tell the difference between a giant insect and a beagle. You're the science officer, you might have offered some assistance in that area. I'm not delusional. It's not unheard of, but I I'm fine. I'm going to recalibrate this to exclude canine biosigns and then I'm going to finish searching this ship. I'm not seeing things and I intend to prove it. Hoshi? Hoshi? Ensign? Hoshi? What are you doing? I have to put you back under sedation immediately. You'll suffer permanent damage. Hoshi? What? Let me get you to Sickbay. T'Pol, please meet me in Sickbay immediately. Captain. What are you doing up? I don't know what's happening. You're not concerned about that? You're not real. You are not real! I was so busy monitoring the crew I never thought to run another neural scan on myself. The effects are subtle and difficult to detect, but there are disruptions deep within my neocortex. You were right. I was hallucinating. I don't believe there'll be any permanent damage. However, it's obviously affecting my judgment. I have no choice but to put myself under neuro-sedation and ask you to look after the crew. With your scientific background, you should have no problems. It won't be for long.

So, Doctor Lucas, while the past few days have proven challenging, both T'Pol and I are relieved that our adventure is nearly over.

They can assist me with the rest of the We should have been out of the disturbance half an hour ago. I thought space travel was supposed to be precise. What do you think I'm doing.

Why so much? That's not going to leave much antimatter for our torpedoes, never mind our engines. I never imagined Captain Archer would put the welfare of a few Xindi before his own people. Do you know, he spent nearly two days in that hatchery. From what I'm told, he hasn't stopped working long enough to even sleep! This is what you wanted to show me, a battle simulation? I asked you to look for weaknesses in their shields, not to play more games. Those manifolds are pretty narrow, but our targeting scanners should be able to get a lock. Nice work. I apologise. I over-reacted. A lot of the crew's on edge lately. I heard things got pretty ugly down there. I've got to get back to the Bridge. Let me know if your simulation finds anything else. What is it? Tactical alert. Captain Archer, report to the Bridge. Pursuit course. Arm phase cannons. Disable their engines. Torpedoes. Maximum yield. Target their impulse manifolds. Fire. An insectoid ship, sir. They were opening a vortex. They would have escaped. Sir? They would have told their superiors, sir. Given away our position. With all due respect sir, they didn't seem particularly interested in talking. I did what was necessary to protect this ship and its mission. Captain. Yes, sir. Stand down, Corporal. I'd advise securing the Bridge first. If Hayes gets wind of this we could have a fire-fight on our hands. That would be risky. If Hayes sides with the Captain, this mutiny will be over before it begins. Ensign Walsh and two of my men. They'll side with us, but Hayes posted two MACO there. Hold it. Sorry. Well, we won't get to the Bridge this way. Stand down! Tell them to stand down. It's over, Major. Take him to his quarters. I imagine not. We couldn't take the chance that you'd side with the Captain. Yeah.",54

We could wait, hang back until we've had a chance to make more repairs. Maybe that's what he's counting on. Lure us into an ambush while we're still licking            our wounds. Aye sir. She was an EPS control specialist, a damn good one. She worked on Rostov's team. I can ask him. I'm barely holding the ship together. I don't have time to sit down to and write a letter. Understood. Tucker to the Bridge. This is not the best time for this. What'd you get? Don't worry, you can pick the pepperoni off. No, the Captain wants me to write a letter to Crewman Taylor's family. Their daughter's dead. Do you really think they'll care what I have to say? I don't know. Not since the attack. All right then, two days. Believe me, I'd love to. I don't have time. We're full of holes. The only thing keeping us            flying is a stolen warp coil, and now I've got to write this letter. What the hell? Tucker to Engineering. Shut down the auxiliary coolant line between sections twelve            and fourteen on E deck. Tucker to Sickbay. Medical emergency on E deck, section twelve. Reactor pressure's holding. Good thing I wasn't taking a nap. There's a microfracture in the magnesium jacket. That's why it ruptured. Tell it to the man lying in Sickbay! Test them again, all of them. I'm a little busy, Doc. T'Pol tattling on me now? Well, I appreciate that, but I'm trying to hold this ship together with spit and            baling wire. Your concern is duly noted, Doc, but I've got to get back to work. Come again? Six hours? I can give you two hours. If I'm gone longer than three there may not be a ship here when I get back. Done. And remind me never to buy a car from you. Captain's waiting for you. Well, goodnight then. Taylor! You were killed. This whole section decompressed. Did you find a sealed compartment? Then how? You're dead, and I'm dreaming. I got as far as 'I regret to inform you.' You're not real. You don't have to call me sir. I wish it was that simple. I'd forgot about that. You will. You would have. Yes. The pounding your ships gave us didn't help much. Try it now. I'm going to            reset the optical subprocessors. That might clear it up. When we slipped through your detection            grid, we got a look at the weapon you're building. An impressive piece of engineering. Hell, it'd take            at least a thousand starships like Enterprise to blow up an entire planet. You know, I'd like to            see the telemetry from the probe you launched against Earth. I assume you were watching the attack, calculating the blast yields. Boy, you must            have been pretty damn excited. I mean, that beam cut one hell of a swath through Florida.            That's the name of one of the places you destroyed. Florida. Did you actually see the cities burning? The houses, the people being           vaporised? I had a sister there. Just need a few more minutes, Captain. Aye, sir. It's one of the warp plasma conduits. We'll handle it. The flow regulators are damaged. There are manual cut-offs here and here, but            we can only access it from outside. We don't have a choice. If we don't get control of it fast, it'll spread to the reactor. I could use a hand. Open that panel and I'll talk you through the cut-off sequence. Over there. I need to open the emergency bypass ports first, and you can't close            your valve until I release the pressure from the secondary lines. Use your plasma torch. I'll be there in a minute. I'm releasing the interlocks            on the first port. Careful you don't cut through the bypass relays, Malcolm. Understood. You okay, Malcolm? Get inside, Malcolm. I can wrap it up.            I'm opening the primary bypass port. Two more to go and we're in business. Get inside, Malcolm. I can finish. A few more seconds. I'm purging the last port. Okay, Malcolm, clockwise ninety degrees. Nice work, Malcolm. Malcolm? Malcolm! Tucker to Doctor Phlox. Meet us in the airlock. What's one more dead human to you? He had no problem killing seven million of us, but seven million and one is more            than you can stomach? I guess even Xindi have their limits. Aye, sir. Computer, begin recording.

I don't know where to start. Have you shown that to Trip? We'll have to contact Degra, tell him we won't be able to make the rendezvous. We'll be thrown back in time. How long will it take? You should have told me. My ship could be destroyed. I'd call that a damn big risk. I've got two T'Pols who disagree with you. It's our best option. This is my mission and my decision. I didn't come over here for a debate. I've already given the order. Trip's short-handed in Engineering. If you could spare a few people he'd get the work done faster. Doctor? Whatever we can spare. You mentioned something about inoculations. Do what you can. I suppose when this mission is over, most of their crew will want to return to Earth. We seem to be cut from the same cloth. I can imagine the look on the Admiral's face when he sees two Enterprises pulling into Spacedock. Keep me updated. What's wrong? Archer to Engineering. Trip, respond. Send a security team. Hail them. Disable their engines. Stay with them. Get down to the transporter, and stand by. T'Pol? You heard her. T'Pol! Now lock onto their primary relays. They're on C deck, junction twelve. This is Captain Archer. Looks like we've got some things that belong to each other. Why don't we call a truce and return our respective property. I know you've got your finger on the trigger. If you fire that torpedo, you're going to hurt a lot of people over here. Lorian, Answer me. You were lucky. Phlox says the injuries on both ships were minor. You almost crippled us. My mission would have been over. Attacking your ancestors doesn't sound very logical to me. I'm sure your crew did everything they could to stop the probe. I could keep you locked up in here, but that wouldn't do either of us any good. All that matters is what we're going to do next. Whether you agree with it or not, I'm taking my ship into that corridor. And I'll stand a much better chance of completing this mission, our mission, if we work together. Take us in. Are the signatures being reflected? How long until we reach the corridor. Return fire. They don't seem to be having the same problem. Malcolm! Archer to Lorian. Now! Well done, Captain. Go ahead. Understood. Lorian, it looks like we're not going to be able to keep up with you. Thanks for the lift. We'll see you on the other side. Target their weapons. Where are we? Are we still in the right century? What about Lorian? One ship against four. Lorian has years of command experience. Something tells me we shouldn't write him off yet. I suppose there's another possibility. Since we weren't thrown into the past, maybe history somehow corrected itself. Go ahead. Put him up.",96

She's been there, Malcolm. That's where she deciphered that third launch code. She's coming with me. I want you and your team to beam in right before we do. Secure the closest route to the platform. I'll give everyone a chance to get to the outer framework. You'll be in charge of helping Hoshi. I've no plans of dying on that weapon, Malcolm. I'm going to see what else she's come up with. I don't have time for this. What about it? I have a team preparing to board the weapon. I've got other things to think about right now. What are you talking about? Then it'll happen some other way. Who's to say whether it'll be better or worse? Where are we? What planet? Seems to me it's just as essential that Earth be around for this too. My mission is to save Earth, not your Federation. My place is on that control platform. Now get me the hell back to Degra's ship. We've got to disable the reactor at a specific point during the inversion sequence, but we don't know the sequence. If it's not done in the right order, internal safeguards will kick in and it'll be impossible to create an overload. I wish I could tell you to take your time. It didn't stop raining for a week. When we get back home I'll see to it you get some R+R in Norway or Canada. Someplace where there's not a tropical bug in sight. Or reptiles. Keep at it. I'll get these to the Bridge. Why would they leave the vortex? Get your team ready to go. Are we in visual range? Yosemite Three. A research post. Usually thirty to forty civilians aboard. Hail them on this frequency. How's Hoshi doing? Remember, no heroics. Just get us in and then keep them off your ass. I'm busy, Shran. What are you doing here? Okay, bring up the inversion sequence. Got it. Hoshi? Got it. Two to go. Hoshi? Go ahead. Good work. Now get back here. Which one, Hoshi? We didn't come here to disable this weapon, we're here to destroy it. Give me the charges. I want the four of you to get to the outer framework. Beam back to Degra's ship. This isn't open for debate, Lieutenant. Don't worry, I'll be right behind you.",50

I don't take orders from a mere governor. We're on important business for the High Council. That matter is classified. You expect me to turn on a transponder and let every ship in the area know that we have the Chancellor on board? He had important negotiations with the Orions. We're taking him back to Kronos. If I were you, I wouldn't be making allegations about Chancellor M'Rek over an unsecure channel. I'm sure you didn't. It would be best if you made no mention of this to your superiors, or you might find yourself commanding a garbage scow. Qapla'. What is it? Can you get a fix on it? Is that so? What were you doing in that escape pod? Your story doesn't sound very plausible. I think we were getting close to finding your Augments.

Doctor Lucas already told me about the missing toxins. You didn't know? You had to see him murder someone in front of you. None of that would have mattered in the end. It's in their nature. They were engineered to be this way. Superior ability breeds superior ambition. One of their creators wrote that. He was murdered by an Augment. Work with Soong. He'll show you how to scan for their warp trail. I want to intercept them before they reach the colony. I believe him. Is that a problem? Do what you have to do. How long until we're in visual range? Same as before, Hoshi. Hail them again. If we don't reach the colony before that bird-of-prey, millions of your people will be killed. Power down weapons. Stand by to deploy the grappler. Take us out of warp. Malcolm? On my mark, Travis. Malcolm? Full impulse. Hold your speed. Hold your speed. Resume course for the colony, maximum speed. Stay with them, Travis. long until we're in weapons range? Trip. Travis. Take us out of warp as close as you can. Malcolm. Hard about. What about phase-cannons? Lock onto their Bridge. Stand aside, Doctor! What good will that do? Do what he says. Fire when ready. I'll contact Starfleet on your behalf. Let them know that you helped us. You're not going to the brig. I'm taking you to crew quarters. No one's destroyed anything. It's being stored in a secure location. Maybe someday, we'll figure out how to use it to benefit humanity. Good-bye, Doctor.",81

Tell Starfleet what we've learned about the embassy bombing. I don't understand. Enterprise will be scanning for us at the transport coordinates. One of us should go there. Taking the artefact to the High Command will accomplish nothing. What war? We settled our dispute with the Andorians nearly two years ago. Where did you get this information? Assuming for the moment you possess Surak's katra, he's been dead for centuries. How could he be aware of plans for a war? Captain. I'm not certain your mind is the one making these decisions. We should return to the ship. T'Pau can take the artefact to the capital. Chosen? Interesting choice of words. That's the fourth patrol today. There's an extensive security grid around the capital. It's unlikely we'll get past it. It's irrelevant what I believe. The Captain could be permanently injured if we don't get him to a doctor soon. It's irrational that we're following someone in his state of mind. What if he dies before we can get help? I apologise. My mother's death has affected me more than I realised. You melded with her? I cannot meld. That's not what I mean. I was forced to participate in a meld several years ago. I was infected with a neural disease. There's no cure. Is there something you can do? Captain, you need to rest. The atmosphere is thinner than you're used to. If you don't stop soon, you'll collapse. Have you had any more conversations with Surak? Something's amusing? I doubt you were Syrran's first choice. You might find it beneficial. Why? There are many groups who claim to follow the true path of Surak. I find no evidence that this one's any different. I may have had disagreements with the High Command, but that doesn't mean I'm going to join a radical faction. This has nothing to do with science! No. Mount Seleya. Because the artefact contains Surak's original writings. Only the priests on Seleya can translate them. I am a Syrrannite. We don't lie. I need to rest. That's a very long time ago. We weren't responsible. You have been misled. Syrrannites are peaceful. I no longer hold that rank. Enter. Captain Archer asked me to express his gratitude. He wouldn't have succeeded without your transporter codes. I'm not certain when I'll be able to return. I'm aware that I promised your family that we would eventually live together.

We have a responsibility to help. I'm aware of that. But we're here. We can't just turn the ship around and leave a man to die. You have your orders. I suggest you get started. And an appetite to match. We can't change what's happened. Maybe some good can come out of it. Let's hope when this is over, you'll have something else to think about. Archer. Keep monitoring. Will it affect the transporter? We're not going to have this argument again. If we beam Quinn aboard there won't be any more of these manifestations. Trip. And you are this close to insubordination. I've made a decision. It's the right decision, and the discussion is over. Can you accept that? Now go do your job. When will that be? We're ready. Forget it. Let's make it worthwhile. Let's get Quinn back. I don't blame you. On the day before I entered flight training, I asked my father pretty much the same thing. Don't fail. He didn't need to be. T'Pol. Go ahead. Emory, Emory, you can't save him. If it means anything, my guess is Quinn would feel the same way. I've been in contact with Starfleet. I'm sure they'll take your achievements into consideration.

So, there is no cure. I'm getting the idea you're up against a deadline. I remember Exobiology 101, Captain. Humans are carbon-based. Our immune system can't fight silicon. There are still a bunch of planets out there we haven't seen. How many languages can you speak? Good? You're a genius. The way you can pick up an alien language you've never heard before and start spouting it back to them? I got to tell you, I've always been jealous you can do that. It's a bit more complicated than that. Sometimes. When I was a kid, not so good at building. But I was a terror when it came to taking things apart. My folks used to put all our kitchen appliances on the highest shelves. One Thanksgiving, I have no idea what I was thinking, but I removed every screw from this big dining room table we had. It was so old, the wood sort of stuck together, so it stayed standing until my dad put the turkey down. I spent the next month in my room. Oh, twenty four, twenty five. How long have they been there? How's the research coming? You're the ones with the medical scanners. Look, if you really want to know how we feel, we'd be a lot better knowing you two were back in Sickbay working on the cure for this. Yeah, unless there's nothing more they can do. Hoshi. Hoshi, wake up. That's where we are. You'll see them again. Hoshi, we're in quarantine for a reason. I have no idea what you're saying, but you can't break the lockout code. Hoshi, you have to stop. That's an airlock. You open those doors, we die. Hoshi, come on. The Captain won't let us down. Trip to whoever's out there. We're back. That could drop a horse. Yeah, she's full of surprises today. Sweet dreams, Houdini. Anything else? Come on, Captain. You think I'm going to wander off, too? Start opening the wrong doors? I'm just wondering if either one of us will ever wake up again. I won't argue with that. The sensations in this host are different from the others. I'm experiencing physical pain. Why should any species have to endure this weakness? Maybe that isn't true for all species. Well, what worked for us might not work for everyone. Humans have different qualities. What do you have against this species? Klingons embrace violence. The humans try to avoid it. I have such respect for you, Captain Archer. Not exactly. I'm an Organian. a nonphysical life-form. Trip is my host. Nothing. We never interfere in the natural development of other species. We only observe. That's why we come here. To see how different species react when they encounter it. I wanted to, but it's not up to me. Because they don't apply to this species. If we don't challenge the rules No. We have the power to save them all. I'm defying the entire protocol. What Archer has done today, his act of compassion, you've never witnessed that before.",78

This may come as a shock, but not everything in my life revolves around you. The dilithium matrix has got to be aligned within point three microns. Who do you think wrote those specs? Exactly. Some guy who's probably never been outside the solar system. I've spent the last three and a half years crawling inside one of these engines. I know what I'm talking about. Biggs, Pierce. I want you to recalibrate the field stabilisers. Rivers and Strong, start with the injector assembly. This bucket of bolts was supposed to leave dry dock six months ago. I guarantee you, Columbia's going to warp out of orbit before the end of the week. Let's get to work. I'm sorry, ma'am. I wanted to see what the situation was like before we spoke. Commander Charles Tucker, reporting for duty. That's right. I think there's a good chance. Any news on Doctor Phlox? We'll be pulling triple shifts if we want to meet this new launch date. I'll be there. Ma'am? Aye, Captain. I don't know who's in charge of your Mess Hall, but he could give the chef on Enterprise a run for his money. Who? I've knocked a few heads together, but we're getting the job done. We'll be ready for warp trials by Thursday. Well, you've got a good memory, Captain. I was getting a little too comfortable on Enterprise. Got a lot of friends over there, but sometimes it's easier to work with people who are just colleagues. I was about to ask you the same thing. Is this a daydream? Well, I would've thought you'd pick a more interesting place. Like the beach, or one of those Fire Plains you showed me. Exactly where am I supposed to go? This is my daydream. You go away. Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks. Just a few more seconds. I hope. Ensign? Nice work. Engineering to Bridge. We're ready whenever you are, Captain.",31

Then end it. Contact Starfleet. You want me to create Klingon Augments. Living weapons. I won't do it. Yes. Yes. That would stop the genetic effects of the virus in stage one. There'd be changes of appearance, some minor neural reordering, but no development of stage two characteristics. No enhanced strength or speed or endurance. But then General K'Vagh would not get his Augments. He would never allow it. Do you understand what will happen if the General learns that we've deceived him? There is no, uh, House of Phlox. Denobulan family units are different from Klingons. Wondrously so. What about the House of Antaak? As a physician in the Imperial Fleet, you've served in the military. I've identified the RNA sequences that code I know where to look for the switch that will turn off the virus. An hour. We're getting the test results now. General, I know the Klingon fleet is on its way, and I understand what this project cost you, personally. Antaak told me about your son. At least he was spared the final stage of this disease. May I ask how he was infected? One of these four strains has the genetic trigger that can neutralise the virus before it advances to its lethal stage. I don't know yet. That's why I have to check each of them. A week. Your fleet can quarantine this world while I complete my tests. Sterilisation is not necessary. The only possible way to get results on Krell's schedule is to infect four healthy Klingons! Only one of these strains will work. The other three will be lethal. Ethically, it's unthinkable. Why did you think you'd succeed in perfecting Augments when Doctor Soong failed? The Earth once had thousands. They became tyrannical and started a war. Augments don't. Their increased aggression is matched by their decreased inhibitions. You'd lose control of them, just as humans did. An hour, at most. I don't believe so. Never on the job. They're quite ill. So are you. Try to rest. That accounts for two of the three lethal strains. If we work quickly, there's a chance we can treat you in time. Load the amino acids. I'll extract the viral DNA from his blood. Captain. Better now that you are here. Gentlemen, please. I think I can speak for myself. Captain. I need a little more time to cure this plague. I lied. Your son may be alive, but he will not survive much longer unless I don't complete my work. A few hours, Captain, that's all I ask. Several million patients are counting on it. Hello, Admiral Krell. This is Doctor Phlox. I am transmitting the details of an antivirus. Feel free to have your physicians confirm my findings, and you're welcome to call with any questions. As I said, in another few hours. I could finish the antivirus in less time if I had a human host to replicate enough antibodies. Captain, I would have to expose you to the plague. I cannot predict what it might do to you. Unquestionably. In addition to the virus, I'm injecting you with a metabolic catalyst to accelerate your immune response. It won't be pleasant. Doctor Phlox here. The Captain is indisposed at the moment. I imagine you have your hands full up there. We have a plan to defuse this situation, but we'll need a few more minutes to carry it out. I'd appreciate it if you could keep the ceiling from caving in on us until then. It's working. It's done! Hold him! We've got it. Is the canister ready? Send it. Open a channel to Krell. Admiral Krell. Doctor Phlox again. By now you may have noticed the Small package which we sent to your Bridge. What you may not know is that it contains a potent sample of the metagenic virus. Even as we speak it is dispersing throughout your ship, infecting you and your crew. Check your internal sensors. You will find That the atmosphere contains approximately twenty parts per million of the viral strain. Or if you don't trust your sensors, trust your senses. You will feel the initial symptoms in about thirty minutes. A tightness in the chest, irregular heartbeat Tingling in your cranial ridges. Maybe so. But I'm prepared to give you the cure. Thanks to Captain Archer, I've managed to complete the antivirus. Of course, if you destroy this colony, well, treating you and your crew could prove difficult. I suggest you power down your weapons, Admiral, and let me cure your people. There's no trace of the virus in your bloodstream. In the future, it may be possible to reverse the cosmetic effects. You did your best to correct your mistakes. That's all we can ask of ourselves. I have a feeling that's about to become very popular. The cravings should disappear in a day or so, along with your ridges.",57

The file states it's an M class world with a flourishing ecosystem. No intelligent life. They did report one distinctive feature which bears mentioning. A species of flying reptile, some reportedly over two hundred metres long. They're also said to breathe fire. There's been lingering questions over the accuracy of this report. I don't recognise the configuration. Is there anything I can do to help? With the engine. I'll take a look at it. Commander, have you been experiencing any unusual daydreams? Accompanied by intense auditory and visual sensations that would involve me. Essentially. Forget I mentioned it. It's not important. No. Why would he divulge this information? So he wants Starfleet to construct mining facilities. Are you going to accept his offer? I thought you were here seeking my advice. I've been hearing some concerns from the crew. The Orion women. Their presence is becoming disruptive. It's more than that. Our guests visited the Mess Hall this morning. As a result, twelve crewmen reported late for their shifts. It's primarily their attire. It might also be a good idea if you have a word with them. They're still under the impression they belong to you. Unless a new policy has been instated, I believe Starfleet doesn't condone slavery. Thank you. Bridge to Captain Archer. Bridge to Captain Archer. We're coming up on the planet. We're already picking up large deposits of magnesite. It would seem so. Are you feeling all right? A power reading. Not on the surface, in the upper atmosphere. Uncertain. The cloud layer is highly ionised. It's obscuring our scanners. It's an unknown configuration. It's equipped with numerous sensors, most likely a science vessel. Its presence here could simply be a coincidence. A phase cannon hit will destroy them. If we simply withdraw, they'll most likely cease their attack and move off. Captain. It's better if I stay on the Bridge. You're not immune to these pheromones. Your judgment is impaired. The Captain asked me to offer my assistance. It's likely. The transmissions sent by the Orion females suggest that Harrad-Sar's ship is getting closer. There have been altercations throughout the ship. The Captain's been affected. I'm concerned about him. That might have something to do with me. There's a long-held belief that when a Vulcan mates, there's a shared psychic bond. It's difficult to explain. Feelings, thoughts, even images can be shared. What? I'm immune to the pheromones because of my Vulcan physiology. Apparently. Reducing gravity plating to ninety percent. His grappler's directly above our main deflector reader. We can use it to send a positron burst through the towing cable. If we're lucky, it'll trigger an energy cascade. T'Pol to Engineering. Understood. Captain. Her presence is affecting your judgment. His engines are down. Weapons as well. It worked. Thank you, Captain. A court-martial would hardly be a fitting ending to this incident. At least we've learned something about the Orions. It proves that even the most disagreeable species have some positive attributes. I assure you, if I ever decide to make a joke, you'll know about it. Proved what? We do seem to work well together. You're returning to Columbia? There are still numerous repairs to be carried out here. Kelby is a fine engineer, but he lacks experience. Say what? I believe I did. I think your presence here would be extremely beneficial to our operations. I don't know what you mean. Wait, Trip. I want you to come back. Trip! Three days ago? Agreed.",71

Still, it'd be tragic if there was an accident on the way to the Brig. Perfectly, sir. Captain on the Bridge. There's one biosign aboard. Tholian. He's seen us. He's arming weapons. Done. It wasn't my doing, sir. I targeted his weapons only. Captain. A distress signal. You think it has a comm. device in there? Sir, I recommend we beam it into space immediately. There are dozens of EPS feeds on this deck, and the only one that overloads is the one connected to the cloaking device. The saboteur entered this junction and deliberately overloaded this EPS waveguide. The intruder alarms were disabled. There's only one way I know of. By running a high-level diagnostic scan. Commander Tucker initiated a scan thirty minutes before the overload. I'd like to see you try. It's likely the crew was executed. If you'd like, sir, I could hold that for you.",21

When we met ten years ago, I didn't trust you. For that matter, I didn't trust any Vulcans. You helped me get past that, remember? I listened to you, now it's your turn to listen to me. I can't turn my back on him, T'Pol. Try to understand. By the way, drop by the galley when you get a moment. Chef's trying to come up with a menu for our last dinner together. He wants to know everybody's favourite dish. Just go see him, all right? Don't worry. Chef's promised at least six kinds of cheese. How reliable are your sources? How many do you expect to show up? Move into a stationary orbit. Put a team together. Meet us in the Launch bay. Well, that's flattering. I appreciate you worrying about me, but I'll be fine. Rigel was the first place we visited, remember? Now it's going to be the last. Poetic justice. Why should you have all the fun? Archer to Shuttlepod Two. Shran's made contact. Everything's set. I'll lead you in. Hold on! Any time. I'll feel more comfortable getting you away from your friends at warp four. All the same, you'll be under your own power by tomorrow night. We'll contact your wife and tell her to expect you the next morning. You're welcome. You should let Phlox take a look at her before you go to your quarters. I'm glad I didn't take your advice about not coming along. Signing documents are easy. Training a new engineer, that can be a real pain in the ass. We'd better hope so. There are thousands of planets within reach. Got to start somewhere. The Tellarites were never big fans of the Andorians, either. This is a special bottle of whiskey. Zefram Cochrane gave it to my father the day they broke ground at the warp five complex. Here's to the next generation. I always crammed before exams. I've got three days left. It's the biggest day of our lives. Archer to the Bridge. What's going on? Who are they? Remind me to mention that to Shran. Shran left six hours ago. You're too late. I'll take care of this. I gave you an order, Commander. Trip! That's enough. Trip, that's enough! Trip? Doctor. I know, Trip. Just take it easy. Everything's all right. No. We'll be right on schedule. I'll even have time to write my speech. Need any help? For his parents? I told them I thought Trip wouldn't want it any other way. Don't forget this. His parents? They're a little eccentric. I think you'll see where Trip got his sense of humour. I remember. Time heals all wounds, but absence makes the heart grow fonder. I guess it's a little tricky. Emotions have a way of contradicting themselves. When I took command ten years ago, I saw myself as an explorer. I thought all the risks would be worth it because, just beyond the next planet, just beyond the next star, there would be something magnificent, something noble. And now Trip is dead, and I have to give a speech about how worthwhile it's all been. You sound like my ninth grade teacher. I'll be proud of myself if I get this speech out in one piece. I know what you meant, Phlox, and I appreciate it, but this is not about me. Thank you, Doctor. You'd better get out there. You don't want to miss me screwing this thing up. You never did like crowds, did you? To boldly go where no man has gone before.",73
